<p class="ph2 nobreak no-indent">PREFACE</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I returned</span> to Russia last summer, visited
as many of my old friends there as I could,
arranged for the publication of some of my
books in the Russian language, and incidentally
travelled a great deal and saw a
great many sides of Russian contemporary
life, talked also with all manner of Russians.</p>

<p>I travelled to Bergen in Norway, from
Bergen obtained a passage round the North
Cape to Vardö, the last port of Norway,
transhipped there to a Russian boat and
sailed for Ekaterina, the first port in Russia
in the North, the new Russian harbour
which never freezes. From Ekaterina I
went on to Archangel, where I stayed a
week, and from Archangel went to Moscow.
I visited some estates in Central Russia
and stayed with various acquaintances and
friends, visited Rostof-on-the-Don, the Caucasus,
Orel, Petrograd, and finally came
back to England on a returning ammunition
ship.</p>

<p>In going to Russia I certainly did not intend
to publish my impressions in book
form, but I have been asked to do so, and
I recognise the value of keeping in contact
with our Ally from day to day. The requirement
of the moment seems to be not so
much books on Russia, of which there are
now a great many, but diaries or volumes
of impressions, keeping the peoples of the
two countries in touch during the war. I
returned to London at the beginning of October,
1916, and I should be glad to think
that some one returning at the beginning of
January, 1917, would follow on with another
small volume of this type. Again for
April, 1917. We need such volumes of personal
impressions, and there would not be
the need to apologise for them. They are
letters between friends both engaged in the
same vital task. It is extremely difficult to
keep in touch with Russia by reading newspapers
only. The newspapers are, on the
whole, difficult to follow. They are concerned
with the news-aspect of events and
the scope for sensational appeals. Good
quiet correspondence tends to be lost in
them. Hence my little book of the hour.</p>

<p>I was in Russia when the war broke out
in 1914. I spent 1915 in Egypt, the Balkans,
Russia and England, and again I spent
the summer of 1916 in Russia. I have,
therefore, been in touch with the Russians
all the time of the war. I hope, therefore,
that in this time when deeds rather than
words are necessary, my report of the conditions
prevailing in the land of our ally Russia
may be considered serviceable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<span class="small">A JOURNEY TO EKATERINA</span></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I proposed</span> to go from Newcastle to Bergen,
to go by Norwegian steamer from Bergen
to Vardö or Kirkenaes on the far north-eastern
limits of Norway, and then wait for
some sort of boat to take me to Ekaterina.
In this I was successful, though it was not
possible to book any passage beforehand in
England.</p>

<p>I left the night the first misleading news
of the North Sea battle was received. If
that news had been correct it would have
meant that the German Fleet had broken
through and was at large, and that each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>war vessel had become a commerce trader.
We stood a chance of being revised by Germans
and perhaps of all English of age
being taken away. A British captain said
to me afterwards, “We received that first
news as we were leaving a South American
port with a cargo of nitre. We realised at
once that the chances must now be considered
against our arriving safely at a home
port.”</p>

<p>Because of the battle the mail boat which
had been due in at Newcastle in the morning,
arrived only at nightfall, the revising
officers were late in coming from the examination
of the one to the examination of
the other&mdash;the <i>Rhanvald Jarl</i>, due to go
out from Newcastle that night. I did not
get to my cabin till half-past-one in the
morning, and had spent some hours among
drunken sailors, one of whom was sick on
the stairs of the Aliens Officer’s room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>
<p>The journey to Bergen was not pleasant.</p>

<p>No one to breakfast, no one to lunch, no
one to dinner. I doubt if any one felt in
the least anxious about German cruisers or
stray mines. There was other preoccupation.</p>

<p>At Bergen I stayed three days in a hotel.
The news in the Norwegian papers did not
flatter the efforts of the Allies. Explanations
of the real significance of the North
Sea battle began to appear, but they had
the suggestion of merely trying to give a
better face to what was in reality a very unpleasant
happening. For the rest the Germans
seemed to be going ahead, and had
captured the fort of Vaux. The only set-off
against these things was the first intelligence
of the Russian advance in Galicia.</p>

<p>I sailed northward in the <i>Vesteraalen</i>,
the Norwegian mail boat going to far
Kirkenaes. Boats go four or five times a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>week the whole distance of the Norwegian
coast. They are slow, but, if time is no
object, it is a most interesting journey&mdash;the
placid fiords and jolly channels between
mountains, the veritable gates in the rocks
which upon occasion you pass through, the
many fishing villages and the trawlers
weighed down with herrings, the busy
women with their knives cleaning the fish
and emptying barrelful after barrelful of
entrails into the sea, the thousands of gulls
ever calling, dipping, screeching, chasing
one another, and then the Lofoten Islands
with their mighty heights, the increasingly
stern more northern aspect of Nature, and
the dwellings of man, the passing of the
Arctic line, the brilliant nights with the sun
still on the shoulder of the sky at midnight.</p>

<p>I fell in with an English Consul, a young
man going to Vardö to do special work in
connection with the war. He was accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
by his wife, and she, for her part,
had never been out of England before. At
every place the steamer stopped we got out
and went for a walk&mdash;sometimes for ten
minutes, sometimes for an hour or so, according
to the extent of the cargo that had to
be discharged or taken on.</p>

<p>At Hammerfest, the most northern town
in Europe, dirty snow still lay on the edges
of the streets. A wild place this Hammerfest,
apparently all men and no women, the
roadway thronged with hardy sailors. A
whole forest of masts in the harbour, an all-pervading
smell of cod liver oil in the town,
a grey and ugly port in June, whatever it
may be later on.</p>

<p>Many Norwegians spoke English, though
with an American accent, and they were
very friendly to us. I was interested, too,
to observe their love of their own land, a
real attachment to the rocks of Norway.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>It is majestic scenery all the way from
Bergen to the North Cape, and it has somewhat
of the characteristic melancholy of the
North. If Russians lived in this land they
would love it for its sadness. But the
Norwegians love its ruggedness, and they
say that the wild and rugged nature of their
land has made them what they are. And
I suppose Scots would find there grandeur
and the sublimity of Nature.</p>

<p>After the North Cape we entered a region
of utter desolation, the coast a line of
snow, the sea grey and dead with the occasional
black back of a porpoise showing.
The wind was cold and wintry. We knew
that at Vardö we should find no flowers, no
vegetation.</p>

<p>At Vardö I left the boat as I had discovered
that boats went to and fro to Russia
therefrom. An important place this Vardö,
and a sharp look-out on Germans should always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
be kept here. If a submarine campaign
against the shipping of Archangel
broke out, there would probably be some
connivance on the part of Germans or neutrals
resident hereabout, and possible bases
on this desolate coast.</p>

<p>A most forlorn region subject to terrific
gales, cold and snowy. It has a great number
of grey wooden docks with grey fishing-boats;
almost all the houses are of wood,
and are of the same grey complexion as boats
and quays, they are low and squat, and the
dirty streets are wide. Innumerable gulls
are diving and dipping and fluttering&mdash;and
shrieking in chorus.</p>

<p>There are two hotels. One is called appropriately
“The North Pole,” the other is
“Vinnans Hotel.” I stayed at the latter,
and this, astonishing to relate, is a first-class
hotel with electric light and a telephone
in every room, though there is no one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>in the town with whom you can communicate.
There is an electric arrangement on
the wall for lighting your cigarette&mdash;you
press a button and a disc becomes red-hot,
and at that you light up. I suppose some
Christiania contractor had put this up, faithful
to the specification quoted in his tender.
My windows had scarlet blinds, and all
night long the midnight sun poured crimson
light on my white bed, the huge wind
howled and bellowed, and innumerable
gulls cried up and down, now this side, now
that.</p>

<p>In the bleak and lonely cemetery are Russian
graves with naïve carvings of the Virgin
and Child on the orthodox wooden
crosses. Many a Russian sailor and fisherman
has perished on this side of his fatherland.</p>

<p>There are amusements in the town, two
cinema shows packed every night, a shooting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
saloon, an Aunt Sallie shy called
“Amerikanske Sport.” I hit down one
ugly face and received as a reward a postcard
picture of a pretty Norwegian girl
about to give a kiss to her beau; there are
band-of-hope meetings with the most excruciating
music, and you see advertised&mdash;raffles.</p>

<p>One day fifteen negroes arrived on a boat
from Russia. They were the crew of the
American ship <i>R&mdash;&mdash;</i> which had brought
ammunition to Archangel, but was in such
a bad condition that the negroes refused to
take it back, got their money and cleared
off. At Vardö one of them had quarrelled
with the rest and was now said to be mad.
No one would take him in, all the girls being
frightened, and the children aiming
stones at him. He was accommodated in
the gaol.</p>

<p>At Vardö there is a most able Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>Consul who is not only most useful to his
own Government, but also to ours, affording
him all the help he can. And a Russian
knows more of this neighbourhood and its
phenomena than an Englishman brought
from Christiania or London. Through
him I learned that a boat would soon be
sailing for Alexandrovsk, the harbour of
Ekaterina, and after a five-days’ stay at
Vardö I got away.</p>

<p>Over the sea once more! In twelve
hours I was at the Russian Monastery of
Petschenga, and next day in a big snowstorm
I came to the new harbour.</p>

<span class="small">THE DARK HAVEN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">From</span> the end of November to the middle
of January the sun does not rise in Russia’s
new haven. All would be dark even at
mid-day were it not for the snow. The
stars never set. The lights in the little
wooden dwellings are never put out. Great
gales blow, rolling up mountainous waves
on the Arctic. Or Polar mists swallow up
everything. Snowstorms go on indefinitely
and the frost may be forty degrees, fifty
degrees. Here is no town, no civilisation.
Alexandrovsk has no pavement, no high
street, no cinema theatre, no hotel, not even
a tavern. Its population is hard, gloomy,
northern. No one has any intelligence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>the great world far away to the south&mdash;the
gaze is toward the North Pole.</p>

<p>They say it has a great future. ’Twill
be a mighty city with roaring traffic and
skyscrapers, theatres, cafés, passion, and
sin. It will be the Odessa of the North.
Valery Brussof anticipates such a city in
one of his fantastic stories&mdash;Zvezdny, the
capital of the Southern Cross Republic,
and as we read we ask&mdash;“Could it be?
Could such a place ever come to be?”</p>

<p>In any case, in the midst of this great destructive
war one piece of constructive work
is in hand, the fashioning of a new port
for Russia far within the Arctic circle. We
hear little of the work in England, or we
hear laconic accounts, such as: “A branch
of railways has been built on from Archangel
to an ice-free port farther north, kept
open by the Gulf Stream,” which is inaccurate
as regards the route of the railway
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>and, moreover, gives the impression that
such a railway is easily built, might, in
fact, be improvised. But in truth it is not
so trivial a matter. The nearer you get to
the actual place the more astonished you are
to recollect the airy opinions you heard expressed
in Fleet Street at home.</p>

<p>The harbour of Ekaterina, on which stand
the town of Alexandrovsk and the barracks
of Semionova, is a queen of harbours, a marvellous
natural refuge, certainly no makeshift
place. And then, as a glance at the
map will convince, it is not near Archangel,
least of all by land. No railway could ever
go direct from Alexandrovsk to Archangel,
and no railway of any kind could easily or
rapidly be built over a thousand miles of
<i>tundra</i>.</p>

<p>Those Russians who live in the north are
in raptures over their new port. Russia
shall face north, the whole of North Russia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>shall be functionised in Alexandrovsk and
Archangel. And, indeed, the longer the
war lasts the better for this northern region
materially. If the war lasts three years
longer Russia will certainly finish up in
possession of a new port and a valuable
railway.</p>

<p>An enormous undertaking this, of trying
to plant a railway on the <i>tundra</i>. Many
have died at work on it; hundreds must
inevitably die before it is a <i>success</i>. It
was difficult to engineer. Russians say
now that it was badly surveyed to start with
and needs re-planning, but in any case it
was extremely difficult to find a way over
the mosses and morasses and along the shores
of the almost continuous lakes that lie between
Kola and Kandalaksha. The map of
the railway is now published in Norway
and Sweden. It might just as well be made
accessible to the English Press. When Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>Kitchener died, maps showing his route
were printed in our papers as if he had been
going to Alexandrovsk (which was not the
case) to travel on a railway which was not
in existence to Archangel! This caused
much amusement in Russia.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the railway runs from
Semionova across the Kola peninsula to the
White Sea at Kandalaksha, and then becomes
practically a coast railway to the
little port of Kem. Thence there is a good
railway to Petrozavodsk and Petrograd.
It does not come near Archangel. Indeed,
if the formation of this new harbour and
railway should be a practical success,
Archangel is almost bound to suffer and to
relapse from its present state of prosperity
to its former somnolence.</p>

<p>The railway when completed will be a
memorable and valuable achievement. It
has taken an enormous amount of labour to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>construct. First, Russian gangs were set
to work and then they were called to fight
for their country. A Canadian contractor
or contracting company was then successful
in obtaining the work. But the workmen
sent over found themselves confronted
by conditions that were necessarily difficult
to have realised in advance. They faced
the problem in a commercial rather than in
a military spirit. And when they had gone
there was almost as much work in prospect
as when they came.</p>

<p>Their place was largely taken by Austrian
prisoners who had volunteered from their
internment camps to come out and work
for a wage. The estimate of the numbers
thus employed ranges from 10,000 to 20,000
men. They were guarded by Cherkesses,
troops from the Caucasus who presumably
had also volunteered, since military service
was not obligatory for them. The Austrians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
worked well and did some of the best
work on the railway. But there was considerable
suffering. Now 10,000 Chinamen,
Kirghiz, and Mongols of various kinds
are at work.</p>

<p>In the summer, except for water under
foot and mosquitoes in the air, the conditions
are good, but in the winter all the
men are working with torches in the darkness.
Despite much forethought on the
part of the Government many of the men
have proved to be yet too thinly clad to
withstand the great frosts. The food from
a European point of view is coarse. Yet
the work must go on, must be done. This
year, before the spring, one engine covered
the whole of the course of the railway&mdash;one
only&mdash;and then the thaw came and
enormous stretches of the track fell away,
were washed off, disappeared.</p>

<p>The Austrians were reported to have laid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>the sleepers purposely on lumps of ice.
When the thaw came they floated off. But
in truth there was nothing much but ice
to lay them on. The Canadians, working
with torches in the darkness, were said to
have failed to fix the rails with the right
balance on the sleepers and the first engine
that passed over worked havoc with the
embankment. So they say in Alexandrovsk,
but, probably, neither Austrians nor
Canadians were to blame&mdash;but Nature
simply had not yet been conquered, though
there was a semblance of conquest at the end
of the winter.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1915 Archangel froze
unexpectedly early, and vessels that could
not discharge there went to Alexandrovsk
to wait for the railway. Ekaterina was
packed with ships&mdash;you could almost step
from one ship to another and thus get across
from one side of the harbour to another.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>And as there were no rings for the moorings
of the ships there was a certain amount of
fear that a storm might arise and the ships
dash themselves to bits against one another.
But, as it proved, no matter how fierce the
tempest raged outside, this virginal harbour
was always placid.</p>

<p>Towards Christmas (one party on Christmas
Eve) arrived our armoured-car men,
now fighting so gallantly with the Grand
Duke in Transcaucasia, telegraphists who
erected the wireless stations, naval airmen,
troops. Men-of-war guarded the harbour.
In that strange Arctic refuge, what an assembly
of British! They remained all the
winter and thought this Russia they had
come to the most God-forsaken place in the
world. Nevertheless, they named the only
street of Alexandrovsk “Pall Mall” and at
their concerts they sang incessantly some
song about “Leicester Square, Leicester
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>Square.” One might think Leicester
Square was really an important place in the
minds of Englishmen.</p>

<p>One obtains the idea that it is perhaps the
Mecca to which the British soldier turns,
and some of the Russian soldiers who are
fighting “to put the Cross on Sancta Sophia”
have a vague idea, hearing our armoured-car
men singing, that perhaps we are fighting
to get back to Leicester Square. Their
marching songs are folk-lore airs with national
words. A contrast to our music-hall
songs imported from America.</p>

<p>On English Old-Year’s night, which is a
fortnight before the same date in Russia,
the men on the ships decided to celebrate
the coming of the New Year with festivity.
The Russians ashore peacefully slept and
the great gloomy cliffs that close the harbour
in were silent as the grave. Suddenly
from all the ships burst forth cries and fireworks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and rockets, songs, shoutings. The
Russians ashore all wakened up and thought
the Germans had come.</p>

<p>This Ekaterina is a great sight, a most
beautiful place, though forbidding and austere,
a symmetrical, flask-shaped exit from
the Arctic. In the storm of driving mist
and snow it was difficult enough finding the
neck of the flask, the way in; but once in,
all was peace, though the storm raged in the
heavens and in the air. There were no
ships to speak of in the harbour then, but a
good deal of life on the shore, especially at
Semionova.</p>

<p>A tatterdemalion Russian population,
some in sheepskins, some in Caucasian
<i>bourkas</i>, some in bowler hats, some in old
khaki overcoats, and smoking pipes&mdash;evidence
of English influence. There were
engineers in leather jackets and with flannel
bashleeks over their heads, workmen in felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>boots, many Circassian troops with their
rifles and in ragged uniforms, men with
pale, severe faces&mdash;they make probably the
most terrible type of Russian troops, silent,
faithful, relentlessly severe and very powerful,
speaking little or no Russian, Mohammedan
by religion&mdash;the guards of the Austrian
prisoners.</p>

<p>When the railway is finished its terminus
will be at Semionova, and that will probably
be the name of the new port. Semionova
is all new, unpainted wood. Here
are hundreds of shanties and barracks, and
an indescribable chaos of workmen, materials,
and mud. Engines puff along the
shore on the bit of railway which is in working
order, and on these engines the various
agents and engineers clamber to go to the
place of action where the gangs are at work.</p>

<p>I fell in with various queer people; a
speculator buying up land, a one-eyed man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>with smoky glasses seeking a site on which
to build a cinema. Eight thousand roubles,
would buy a cinema with all fixtures, including
an electric piano. It was bound to
be a success, he argued, for there would be
no other place to go to in the long black
winter. Land has been bought up all
round the harbour, and by people who have
never seen it&mdash;just for speculation, the curse
of modern life in Russia. And all the time
whilst Russian peasants and workmen are
slaving and dying, comfortable commercial
folk in the south are buying and selling the
prospective fruits of their labour and sufferings.</p>

<p>Still, that is the way of the world, and
these people pass, whereas the work remains.
All the autumn and possibly
through the winter the work goes on again
in the continuous darkness, with torches,
under the supervision of fur-clad engineers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>and grim Cherkesses. Many will be the
sufferings, though not greater than the sufferings
on the field of battle. Many have
died and will die in the building and consummating
of the Murman railway. Still
the railway will remain as a peaceful memorial,
the great new railway from Petrograd
to the dark haven.</p>

<span class="small">THE NEW ARCHANGEL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> I last visited Archangel, six years
ago, it was a dreamy, lifeless, melancholy
port. One felt that, like its sister city,
Kholmagora, it had once been great, but
its greatness had finally set. You could feel
the melancholy of Russia there, the sadness
of material failure so characteristic of the
Russian soul. But to-day! To-day the
vision has fled, the <i>tempo</i> has changed. All
the ships of the world find anchorage in
her harbour, and motley crowds throng her
streets. That the war has brought about.
A year before the war fifty vessels entered
Archangel port. During the last twelve
months something like 5000 have entered.
Great liners and transports and weather-beaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
tramps and three-deck river boats
stand in majestic pride. Their smoke and
steam make a dome over the city of Archangel
when you approach it from the north.</p>

<p>There are Norwegians and Yankees, with
their colours flamboyantly painted on their
bows to warn the submarine off; Russians
and French, with their tricolours streaming;
but most of all English ships, with
their proud rain-washed Union Jacks lolling
in the wind. I was taken through the
whole harbour in a little, arrow-like steam
launch&mdash;from the Thames! How often it
had shot under the arches of our little
bridges, and now it was puffing and panting
on the vast brown Dvina, be-dwarfed by
huge ships, driven by a Lett from Riga, and
constantly going short of steam and getting
becalmed far from either shore.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Besides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>troops, the French are taking great quantities
of alcohol used in the manufacture of
high explosives, and I saw many barges
heaped up with barrels of spirit and wondered
if there were many leaks. The Russian
manufacture of alcohol has probably
not diminished as a result of the prohibition
of the sale of intoxicating liquors in Russia,
but has proved to be a valuable war export.
This fact is especially important to take into
consideration with regard to Russian temperance
reform. When the war is over
and the market for this alcohol is partially
lost, will there not be another movement of
resistance on the part of the manufacturers?</p>

<p>I saw all manner of crates with machinery,
parts of aeroplanes, and the like,
and British vessels discharging these things,
and I saw grain and flax and timber going
on for us from Russia.</p>

<p>Go into the chief restaurant of Archangel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
and as like as not all the customers
are English captains, and they are reading
back numbers of the <i>Daily Mail</i> and talking
“ship.” At the Café Paris there is a
“skippers’ table,” where they are also captains
all, and the waitresses quarrel as to
who shall serve there, though none of them
knows two words of English. In the Alexandrovsky
Gardens you see English sailors
with Russian girls, and neither can say a
word to the other. Their only language is
that of looks. One of our men showed me
a card with poetry written and violets
painted and asked me to translate the words
for him and write an answer. It ran something
like this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What need for words when without them you are so</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">eloquent?</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Why should the lips move</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">When the eyes speak so well?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sailors tell wonderful stories of feminine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>conquests, and it is evident the Russian
girls are partial to them. Even at the
theatre, in front of you are sitting such unlikely
persons as a fireman and a stoker,
and one says to the other with disgust, “I
can’t understand a blooming word. Can
you?” Some Englishmen have exercise
books with Russian words and phrases
laboriously copied out&mdash;an impossible language!</p>

<p>All is going well in Archangel. The
Russians, in spite of their inexperience, are
handling the immense quantities of materials
well, and the “stuff” is all steadily
proceeding to the places where it is most
needed. New quays have been built, and
loops of railway run along them, and some
ships, carrying nothing weighing less than
three tons, yet discharge all their immense
articles of cargo in considerably less time
than it took to put them on at Liverpool
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>or Dundee or Newcastle as the case may be.</p>

<p>The Russians earn unheard-of wages in
the docks, and the rumour attracts thousands
of workers from all parts of Russia.
A journalist writing in the <i>Russkoe Slovo</i>
in July called it the Russian Klondike.
All Russians who go there are pleased with
it. The port in its present grandeur is a
sort of promise for Russia, and it flatters
her commercial future.</p>

<p>I was warned I should not find a room
anywhere in the city, and that people paid
five roubles a night for the privilege of
sleeping in a passage. But I obtained a
clean room at the Troitsky Hotel for 2
roubles 75 copecks, which was not dear.
Notices in the room were printed both
in English and Russian, indicating how
many English visitors they have now.</p>

<p>I called on my friend Alexander Alexandrovitch
Beekof, the hunter and draper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>whom I described in “Undiscovered Russia.”
He had now opened a boot shop and
was rich, selling his wares at three or four
pounds the pair. He was proud of his
business success and rejoiced in the independence
which it gave him. He is now a
member of the Gorodskaya Duma, and
when a representative of the city was
wanted to carry an emblem to the Archangel
troops at the front, Beekof was
thought to be the best.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He shared the
hardships of the common soldiers, and was
fain to stay at the front, but was mixed up
in the great retreat from Austria and felt
very sick of everything before he got back
to his native city and the boot shop.</p>

<p>Since I was in Archangel last the young
revolutionary exile Alexey Sergeitch, now
pardoned and married and teaching history
in Moscow, has brought out a little book on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>the Monastery of Ci. I saw him later
when I got to Moscow.</p>

<p>I was invited by the town council to partake
of a glass of tea on the occasion of the
opening of the electric tramway. All the
notables of the town were accommodated
on board a special steamer, and went slowly
along the Cathedral pier a mile or so to the
new electric power station. Here priests
met us with banners and ikons and holy
water. A service was held in the power
station, and the smell of burning incense
mingled strangely with the smell of new
paint and oil and machinery. Holy water
was flung in all corners and over our heads,
and then the dynamos were set in motion
and the whole place buzzed and groaned.
I think Repin, the engineer, proud of having
constructed the most northern tramway
in the world, was a little anxious lest the
holy water should spoil his engines.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>
<p>But all went well, and we took our seats
in the virgin trams to make the first journey,
all the notables of the town and with
them every beggar and labourer and tatterdemalion
dock-hand that could get a footing.
In Germany I can imagine how
swiftly these gentlemen would have been
dealt with. But in Russia “all is permitted”
and we had a joy-ride. We went
cheerfully along on our parade journey.
The conductresses in brand new uniforms
and shining metal clips and punches stood
with their money bags and their full rolls
of tickets. Directly following our trip to
the Town Hall the cars were open to the
public, and fares would be collected. Car
after car drew up and we stepped out and
walked up the stone stairs to the long tables
and the glasses of tea and the proud speeches
of the great men of Archangel.</p>

<p>Now the trams are in full operation, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>bring in about £1,000 a week. Archangel
is united, and friends within the city have
become nearer. All day the trams carry
passengers, and all night they carry goods,
so I am told.</p>

<p>As I write of this now in the winter after
I have come back to London, I imagine that
probably now all is frozen over again.
The brown river became white, and within
twenty-four hours you could drive a horse
and cart over it. It did not melt again till
the spring. Captains and their crews
thinking of leaving in a few days and grumbling
because of small delays as they always
do grumble, were suddenly condemned to
remain idle for months; their ships, dotted
here, there, and everywhere in the ice, had a
processional aspect, and looked as if they
were sailing out and yet never getting forward.
The men cut pine branches and
made avenues from their ships to the shores,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>well-trodden roads with names. There
was “Broadway” leading to a big American
ship, and K&mdash;&mdash; Avenue leading to the
<i>K</i>&mdash;&mdash;, and <i>R</i>&mdash;&mdash; Avenue leading to the
<i>R</i>&mdash;&mdash;. I may not mention the name of
any British ship, but the detail has a picturesqueness
which is worth noting. The
Russian Government paid the owners of
these boats hundreds of thousands of roubles
damages for this unexpected incursion of
Jack Frost. It was highly unprofitable to
Russia, but every one made the best of it
and no one grumbled.</p>

<p>The happy co-operation of the Russians
and the English shows to advantage in
Archangel. Russians and English like one
another and get on well together there,
though the souls of the common people are
so different and Russian ways so different
from our own.</p>

<span class="small">THE COST OF LIVING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Each</span> time returning to Moscow I notice
change. Last year after the riots it was a
city of broken windows and more or less
empty streets. This summer I found the
life patched up and the windows more or
less repaired. There were more people;
there was an obvious prosperity of a kind,
among the shopkeeping class. Every one
talked of the dearness of living and yet
every one had more money wherewith to
buy. And all shops were thriving. Many
shops with German names have now put
up a notice to the effect that the owners
are Russian. Not that the German shops
which were sacked in July, 1914 have recovered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Einem, the great confectioner,
with all his branches seems to have sold his
retail business. The first-rate art shop and
publishing house of Knebel &amp; Grossman has
had to obtain a Government loan in order
to make a start again and supply the schools,
but most precious negatives and blocks and
originals perished, and it will be a long
time before the firm can make up for what
was lost. Many new cafés and places of
amusement have been opened, testifying to
the money in people’s pockets. Rich fugitives
from the districts conquered by the
Germans and Austrians seem to have
started businesses in Moscow and have imparted
to it a tinge of the complexion of
Warsaw&mdash;part of the extra gaiety of Warsaw
seems to have arrived; one notices such
new names as that of the Piccadilly Café
opposite Phillipof’s.</p>

<p>Apart from that street gaiety, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>there is sufficient sadness and anxiety in the
background. As in England and France,
every family has its personal stake in the
war, and for many that stake has become the
wooden cross over a grave. Young and
splendid regiments are still to be seen
marching, however, and to look at them in
their new uniforms one might think for a
moment that it was only the beginning,
Russia was entering the war, and no one had
yet been lost.</p>

<p>There is engaging enthusiasm still, and
withal the noted Slav patience that does not
ask for things to be done quickly. A slow
war in many respects suits the Russian temperament.
The most characteristic thing
in Russia is the waiting: waiting hours for
your ticket at the booking-office, waiting
hours for Chinovniks, waiting for one’s
money at the bank, waiting for a turn to buy
a seat for next week’s performance at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>theatre, whole days if Shaliapin be going
to sing. And now they are waiting with
their accustomed cheeriness and patience.</p>

<p>Certainly they have their hardships, those
who dwell in the background. They have
plenty of subjects for grumbling and complaints.
Their talk is all of the terrible
<i>dorogovizna</i>. The pretty word <i>dorogovizna</i>
means dearness of living, and it is the
commonest in the townsman’s vocabulary
this season of the war. The price of nearly
every commodity in Russia has doubled or
trebled since the outbreak of war. One
would expect the price of manufactured
goods to rise there; but the surprising
phenomenon is that, despite the overwhelming
abundance of foodstuffs in Russia and
Russia’s inability to export any of that
abundance, food has become, on the whole,
dearer than in Berlin. The <i>Russian Word</i>
has a long list of comparative prices, showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
that out of sixteen common articles of
food ten have increased more in price in
Moscow than in Germany. The price of
mutton has increased 180 per cent. in Berlin,
but it has increased 281 per cent. in
Moscow; pork 114 per cent. in Berlin, 142
per cent. in Moscow; white bread 27 per
cent. in Berlin, 45 per cent. in Moscow;
sugar, 27 per cent. in Berlin, 57 per cent. in
Moscow, and so forth. Sugar has in many
districts disappeared entirely, and shop
windows exhibit the notice “No sugar whatever,”
which means not even the dirty
brown soft sugar which has displaced the
<i>rafinade</i>. At Archangel there is a fixed
allowance of 1 lb. of sugar per person
per month, and that is only accessible for
settled inhabitants. As a visitor I was
lucky to purchase twenty-four lumps at a
halfpenny a lump. At the railway stations
at many buffets you are offered sugar candy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>or raspberry drops with your tea, or a
wrapped caramel with your coffee. In
cases where they have sugar the waiters
have the audacity to put it in for you, lest
you should secrete what you did not want.
Now cards have been introduced for sugar
almost everywhere, even in the villages.
The possession of a card entitles you to purchase
the article specified on it. At first
receiving the food card the heart rejoices.
But it is one thing to possess a card and another
to find a grocer who has anything to
sell. If we introduce cards in England we
shall probably experience the same anomaly,
though we have certainly more gift for
organisation than the Russians. For food
tickets to be a success an extraordinary thoroughness
in administration is necessary and
also a good social conscientiousness on the
part of individuals.</p>

<p>When the blue food cards were distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
in one village a rumour spread that
the Anti-Christ had arrived in Russia and
was giving these out. It is said that one inhabitant
of foreign origin bought up all the
cards from the peasants at a low price, and
they now contentedly buy their provisions
from him when he has them.</p>

<p>Meat has so risen in price that throughout
all Russia four meatless days have been
proclaimed, and on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday you must keep to
vegetables, fish, or fowls. On these days
no meat may be sold and no cattle may be
slaughtered. The meat may not be sold in
a smoked state nor as sausage. When this
measure was introduced the butchers
wailed, if the cows and the calves rejoiced.
The chickens suffered for it. But ask a
Russian, and he will tell you all suffer for
it. The price of vegetables has risen, the
price of meat on the days when you buy it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>has risen, the price of fish and fowl has
risen. One day at the National Hotel in
Moscow I noticed cauliflowers standing at
the superb price of 3 roubles, 50 copecks,
about 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>From scores of districts in Russia petitions
have been sent to Petrograd&mdash;Cancel
the regulations as to meatless days. But
the regulations are not likely to be cancelled.
At the restaurants such small portions
are given that it is difficult to make a
good meal even at large expense. And the
soups which are made without meat are the
same price as they used to be when meat was
allowed. It seems that if meatless days are
to be introduced in Britain it will not be
merely one a week for it is always possible
to buy meat for two days. They should be
for three or four days a week as in Russia.
But phenomena similar to those I noted will
be repeated with us. Vegetables will rise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>rapidly in price as a result of meatless days.</p>

<p>Sugar has disappeared because the Germans
and Austrians are in possession of
some of the richest beetroot country of Russia,
and also of several sugar factories.
Coffee is scarce because there is war with
Turkey; butter and eggs because the peasants,
being unable to obtain vodka, have
no particular use for extra cash, and won’t
sell their products. Speculators are holding
large quantities of provisions in ice-houses
and waiting till the prices are pushed
higher and higher. The banks are holding
quantities of sugar. There are many explanations.</p>

<p>In one window in Moscow is exhibited
a notice, “Soap is received daily and is sold
in lumps of not less than 10 lb. up to 10
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>”; in other windows is the notice, “No
soap,” and one involuntarily recalls that
piece of nonsense&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">A great she-bear passing down the street. What, no
soap; and so she married the barber,</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">in which some Mrs. Gallop might read an
occult reference to the Russia of these days.</p>

<p>Boots have become difficult to buy. Existing
supplies are nearly exhausted. In
a boot-shop window in Moscow one pair of
boots exhibited&mdash;the last. Second-hand
boots are valuable. Boot thieves have appeared
in the hotels, and a new notice has
appeared in your room, “You are requested
not to put your boots out at night.” My
friend Beekof, of Archangel, made a huge
pile of money selling boots. I met him
lately in Moscow where he has been purchasing
expensive works of art, and even
thinks of buying an original Levitan.
Boots are too expensive to buy. They say
plaited birchbark or lime-bark boots, which
used to be sold for 2<i>d.</i> a pair in the country,
now fetch 5<i>s.</i> Peasants are sitting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>plaiting boots on suburban stations and selling
them as fast as they make them. Repairs
are so expensive that a parlourmaid
spent a month’s wages on having her boots
mended. Happily the town councils have
fixed a tariff in Moscow and Petrograd at
last, both for boots and for repairs.</p>

<p>Russian houses are heated with wood, and
strange to say, in the midst of her enormous
forests she is short of wood. Wood
has doubled and trebled in price. The
poor people must freeze. There are not
working hands to cut wood&mdash;so many having
been taken for more profitable occupations.
I have been asked a shilling for a
packet of rubbishy envelopes. Paper is
very dear&mdash;some of the best Russian paper
mills are in the hands of the enemy. All
metal articles are expensive. A decent
samovar costs 50 to 60 roubles. There is
said to be famine in medicine, and the chemists’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
supplies are short. Certainly the Russians
seem to be enjoying better health on
the whole.</p>

<p>They say all is going to be regulated.
The Government is going to take charge
of the whole business of supply and there
will be cards for everything, and you must
call at the grocer and present your card.
Once more calls and cards, and cards and
calls. But our Russian friends are the most
unpractical people. You see every day in
Moscow queues a street long, waiting hours
with cards in their hands, waiting for a
pound or so of sugar. Such queues turned
up at the butchers’ shops on the mornings of
the meat days that the butchers decided to
issue tickets the day beforehand&mdash;on each
ticket a number designating your turn to buy
meat on the morrow. Thus recently 2,000
waited on Arbat from 4 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> to midnight
for a ticket for a turn next day. The vegetarian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
propagandist turns up to look at their
solemn faces. “Is it worth it?” he asks.
Happy vegetarians!</p>

<p>“But you know if I don’t get meat my
stomach will go wrong,” says a Russian
plaintively.</p>

<p>“What is tea without sugar?” says another.
“And what is life without tea?”</p>

<p>Another comes to the doctor and says,
“Prescribe, if you please. I’ve lost my
appetite. I can’t eat.”</p>

<p>And the doctor replies, like that friend of
Carlyle&mdash;</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, it isn’t of the slightest
consequence.”</p>

<p>“The Army has meat, tea, sugar, white
bread?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Army has all these in plenty.”</p>

<p>“Slava Tebye Gospody! That’s all
right.”</p>

<span class="small">LIFE IN THE COUNTRY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Moscow I journeyed to see some
friends of the artist Pereplotchikof, the E.
family, on a small estate in the Government
of Voronezh. At the small wayside station
an unfamiliar figure greeted me&mdash;this
was an Austrian prisoner, a Hungarian
who could not speak a word of Russian.
He was the new coachman, and would drive
me the ten miles to the farm. The former
coachman has gone to the war, and so now
an Austrian prisoner, in the same uniform
in which he surrendered and wearing the
familiar high military hat, is doing his
work. He carried my bags from the station,
for there was no porter, and put them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>in the carriage, and then drove me on
through verdant forest and along the terrible
road deep in liquid mud and water.</p>

<p>A great feature of the new country life in
Russia is the Austrian prisoners at work.
One seldom comes across any Germans.
But of Austrians there are great numbers.
They volunteer to go out to work, rather
than remain in the internment camps. In
order to obtain Austrian prisoners to work
on an estate you apply to the government
town, and they are hired out to you at eight
roubles a month, four roubles of which are
allowed to be deducted for keep. It turns
out that on the whole the prisoners work
merely for board and lodging and what
would keep an ordinary smoker in tobacco.
Prisoner labour is altogether cheaper than
that of ordinary Russian labourers. So if
you can get a strong detachment of prisoners
on your estate you are somewhat advantageously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
circumstanced. No guards, however,
are supplied with the prisoners, and
you are held responsible for them in case
they attempt to escape. The prisoners
on the land are generally those who were
agriculturists in their native Austria and
they are highly serviceable. They do not
take their new duties too seriously, but all
the same do more work than the average
hired Russian labourer would do. To
work is more pleasant to them than to sit
together and talk or sing, and their industrious
habits are a matter of pleasant surprise
for their employers.</p>

<p>On Mme. E.’s estate the prisoners were
Hungarians. She knew no Hungarian,
they no Russian, and no grammars or dictionaries
of the Hungarian language were
obtainable in Moscow or Petrograd&mdash;the
only aid to learning the language which
Mme. E. was able to obtain was an officer’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>war guide containing maps, geographical
details, and five or six pages of military
phrases with translations. Even so, good
progress was being rapidly made in mutual
understanding. These Hungarians will
carry back to their own country many
funny-sounding Russian words, and on the
other hand some Hungarian expressions
may remain locally.</p>

<p>Certainly the prisoners are of great economic
aid to Russia. Each Austrian
captured is not only one Austrian less in the
enemy ranks, but one harvester more to take
in the precious grain. The Russian women,
the old men and the children, seem to be insufficient
to keep up the present extent of
cultivation and to reap the harvest&mdash;the labour
of the prisoners makes up the deficiency.</p>

<p>In many respects the prisoner of this
foreign element in the midst of Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>country life is sufficiently objectionable
from the Russian point of view. There
are said to have been a number of marriages,
though the difference in religion
must have precluded the possibility of legal
marriage in most cases where it may have
been desired.</p>

<p>There is a cloud over the village, and it
cannot be said that the war is popular
among the women. They want the men
back; the wives want their husbands, the
girls want their sweethearts. Girls of sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen are
persistently gloomy. They feel that time is
slipping past without bringing the necessary
bridegroom. They should have been
betrothed and married by now. Nineteen
is a dreadful age for an unmarried
girl&mdash;she feels herself already an old maid,
and is disinclined to tell her age. Pretty
Tania the serving-maid does not look so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>pretty this year; she has let the fact that she
is eighteen prey upon her mind. She
knows that when the boys come back they
will not look at any one so old as she, and
she will be left.</p>

<p>On festival nights there is the same singing
in the village street, the parade of village
fashions, but somehow it is rather
meaningless since there are no male partners
and no weddings can be arranged. Letters
of course go to and fro between the Army
and the village, but the soldier does not
write to “his sweetheart,” or if he does it is
because his sweetheart is his wife. For
long engagements do not take place in the
country. Queer letters the soldiers send
back, full of greetings to neighbours and
relatives, and containing little or nothing
about the war. There is never any need to
censor them. The peasant wives bring
their letters to Mme. E. and she reads them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>aloud. Or they come to her when they
want to write their letters, for though most
of the men can read and write, the women
seldom are able.</p>

<p>My hostess was delightful with the peasants.
She has taught among them, nursed
them, cared for them, and understands their
souls. She sits with pen and paper on the
sunny verandah of the big sunny house and
writes at dictation whilst the peasant wife,
with her hands dangling at her side, maunders
on about the cow, the hole in the roof
which needs mending, the state of the crops,
little Willie’s health, the amount of work
these Austrian prisoners do, and so on.
She puts down literally what the <i>baba</i>
says, as if she were doing an exercise in
phonetics, and never corrects a word or a
wrong expression or a grammatical error.
The consequence is that the soldiers at the
other end actually hear their wives speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to them, and highly appreciate it. The
letters which Mme. E. writes for the wives
are the best.</p>

<p>Still, letters are makeshift ways of talking
to one’s nearest, and it is a great day
in the village when a soldier actually returns,
a wounded man invalided back or a
man with some sort of message. Alas, Russian
troops get very little “leave” whilst
they are well. It often happens that from
the day of mobilisation to the peace day
when the men come home, nothing is seen
or heard of the common soldier&mdash;especially
when he cannot write. Lists of casualties
in the ranks are not published, and the village
has to wait patiently to know whom it
has lost and who are saved. More attention
is paid to officers, even to ensigns, and
I met down here in Voronezh Province a
private who had been sent from the front
to convey to the home people the decorations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
and last tidings of a young ensign who
had perished leading his men. This officer
had been greatly beloved by the soldiers&mdash;they
rushed to him when he fell, and he
seemed merely to be asleep. But one bullet
had gone through his mouth and two
through his skull. He was given the Cross
of St. George after his death, and a soldier
was detached to carry the last honours home
and tell the tale of his death. Incidentally
the soldier brought to the village his story
of the war.</p>

<p>A rainy summer in the village. In many
places the priests prayed for the rain to
stop. The hay rotted where it lay, and
could not be taken in, but the wheat and the
rye were good everywhere. And the fruit
harvest was good. Some one made a handsome
profit on apples, since the common
price in Moscow was threepence or fourpence
apiece. Despite the dearth of sugar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>jam-making was carried on in the country
to an even greater extent than usual. People
felt that it was a good way to save sugar
for the winter, to put it into jam. Russian
jam is much sweeter than ours, and is often
put in tea as a syrup. It is never spread
on bread and butter. Mme. E. obtained
several sacks of soft sugar, about three hundredweight
in all, and the half of that she
used for making jam.</p>

<p>The orchard’s fruit, however, had been
sold in advance in the spring. An Armenian
had come, considered the blossom,
and offered a price which was accepted.
He had made a good speculation as it
turned out, and he put a watchman in
among the trees with a dog to see that
nothing was stolen. The watchman was
one of the unfortunate refugees from the
territory now occupied by the Germans.
Two years ago he had been a prosperous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>farmer with his own land and horses and
cows and what not, now he is a miserable
half-savage in sheepskins lying in a rain-soaked
straw shelter in the orchard&mdash;sans
land, sans wife, sans everything. A Roman
Catholic he, but he went to the Orthodox
Church on Sunday, as did also the Hungarian
prisoners, for they said in their halting
way what it is difficult for the more
prosperous to understand, that <i>Bog odin</i>,
God is One, and that if there be no Catholic
church by, it is as easy to pray to God in
the church that there is.</p>

<span class="small">FATHER YEVGENY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> faces in the passing crowd are always
somewhat of an enigma. There are so
many that we do not know, each with his
own wide story, which, however, does not
touch our story. One is tempted to go up
and place the hand in the slightly unwilling
and doubtful hand of the stranger and say,
“I know you, do I not?” And it is always
somewhat of a miracle if in the midst of the
sea of faces there suddenly turns up the familiar
face. There happened to me when
I returned to Moscow after my stay at
Mme. E.’s a miracle of this kind. I met
one of my pilgrims again, one of those I accompanied
to Jerusalem five years ago,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>whom I did not expect to see again&mdash;the
aged hermit Yevgeny.</p>

<p>I passed and repassed him twice, and he
for his part stopped and seemed to be
vaguely wondering what he should do next.
’Twas outside the Yaroslavsky station, and
I was hurrying to catch a suburban train to
visit some friends. There was a great swirl
of traffic, and many trams were circling and
groaning, emptying and receiving passengers.</p>

<p>“Father Yevgeny,” said I. “Do you not
recognise me?”</p>

<p>He seemed taken aback, and shrank rather
as if the devil had taken a new form to tempt
him. I recalled that he was considerably
troubled by the devil.</p>

<p>“We met at Jerusalem, did we not?” said
I. “Don’t you remember, we used to read
the Bible together in the mornings?”</p>

<p>Then he recognised me, and a bright and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>happy smile transfigured his pallid, wrinkled
cheeks and sunken eyes.</p>

<p>He lifted up his bent shoulders and kissed
me, first on one cheek, then on the other,
and proclaimed in a loud voice, “God has
done this. It is a miracle. He meant that
we should meet again. But how changed
you are! You have grown taller. Yes, it is
you. But it is a miracle. God has done
it.”</p>

<p>We were a strange contrast. I in a light
summer suit and wearing a straw hat; he,
in any case a remarkable figure, tall though
drooping, with yellowish-white ancient
locks and toothless gums. Several people
stopped to look at us, and some approached
more closely to hear what we were talking
about. The representatives of two contrary
worlds seemed to have met, for I
clearly belonged to that gay, worldly, commercial
Moscow which is so out of touch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>with Holy Russia, and the monk was one of
those forbidding figures one would not expect
to smile and be demonstrative in the
public street.</p>

<p>I wrote him my address, and he promised
to come to me on the morrow. I then sped
on to catch the train, my heart full of delight
at this surprising meeting, this true
miracle to which the bright Sunday had
given birth.</p>

<p>Next day Yevgeny came to the hotel at
which I was staying and asked for me. He
had put on for the occasion an old straw
hat and over it a surprisingly old and dirty
Egyptian sun-helmet. In his hand he bore
a tall cypress staff with a cross on the top, a
true palmer’s staff, but a rare enough sight
in Moscow.</p>

<p>The porter of the hotel is artificially made
fat like a swell coachman, and he wears
in his hat a circle of tips of peacock-feathers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>which make him look very grand. It is his
business to know every one who goes in and
out of the great hotel. Probably for the
first time in his experience a monk made to
enter the establishment. Father Yevgeny
and he&mdash;again two worlds confronting one
another.</p>

<p>“No. 214 on the second floor,” said the respectful
man in charge of keys and correspondence.</p>

<p>“This way!” said a small boy, pointing to
the lift.</p>

<p>But old Yevgeny had never been on a lift
in his life.</p>

<p>“My sinful old legs will carry me up,”
said he&mdash;he mounted the many stretches of
broad carpeted stairway to the second floor,
which is really the third. There was a
timid knock at my door, and my visitor had
arrived.</p>

<p>“Father Yevgeny!” I cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>I showed him his portrait in my book,
and translated aloud the chapter written
there about him. He seemed to be extremely
pleased. We considered the portraits
of the other pilgrims in turn.
Abraham, who had been twenty times to
Jerusalem, was of a Cossack family. The
man carrying the lantern designed for the
holy fire was now dead. The priest standing
beside the dead pilgrim in the picture
was now at Troitskaya Lavra. I made Father
Yevgeny a present of the volume, and
he bade me write in it in Russian, “To the
hermit Yevgeny of Mount Athos.”</p>

<p>“How is it you come to be in Moscow and
not at Mount Athos?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The war prevented me. I had come
back to Russia to visit my native village before
I died, and whilst I was here the war
broke out. I was hastening back, but our
Moscow Metropolite put his hand on my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>head one Sunday after morning service and
said, ‘Thou art thinking of going to Afon&mdash;wait,
do not go.’ Then war with Turkey
commenced, and the way was stopped.
Good Father Philaret of the Bogoyavlensky
Monastery gave me shelter, and that is
where I am living now.”</p>

<p>He recounted how, when the war broke
out, he had a vision. He looked up into
the sky, and it was filled with little white
clouds hurrying southward. He was mistaken
in thinking them clouds; he saw later
that they were in fact the hosts of the angels
ranging themselves on the side of Serbia
to save her from the Austrians.</p>

<p>Yevgeny and I spent the whole day together.
In the evening I had to leave Moscow,
and he saw me off at the station. He
talked a great deal about his visions. For
instance, he had seen the Kingdom of
Heaven. One sunny afternoon in the monastery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
yard he fell into a trance, and in the
trance he saw what he had wanted to see all
his life&mdash;a vision of the Kingdom. “There
are really four heavens,” said he. “The
first is so splendid, so full of light, that it is
almost impossible to look at it; and in the
midst of the light sit the Holy Trinity.
Round and round them all the while and
for ever the cherubs keep moving and they
sing oi-oi-oi-ei-ei-ei-ai-ai-ai ... and never
cease for a moment. In the second heaven
I saw the apostles and the prophets. In the
third heaven were the holy <i>ugodniki</i>, and
in the fourth were a great crowd of all sorts
and conditions of men and women all in
white. There were many, many of our
Russians there&mdash;I was so glad, so full of
joy that I went. And then suddenly it all
vanished, and I found myself in the monastery
yard and on my knees, and my hands
were on the white head of an old, old pilgrim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
woman. I asked her if she had seen
anything, but she had seen nothing.”</p>

<p>I asked Father Yevgeny about the Mount
Athos heresy, and the Name-of-Godites, as
the heretics were irreverently called. I
had a faint suspicion that Yevgeny might
be one of them. But he was very robustly
against them. “It all sprang from one
man who was himself illiterate,” said he.
“He held that as the Three were One, therefore
Jesus and God were one and the same,
and that in the beginning Jesus made the
heavens and the earth. And he got a great
following among the Russian monks. But
he was altogether in the wrong, and if he
had read he would have understood that
Jesus the Son of God was born in the fulness
of time, and the Name of God must
therefore have priority. Ah! now they
have all confessed they were wrong, and
have been pardoned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>We walked out into the Moscow streets,
and all the while the old monk talked most
energetically, and made astonishing gestures.
One moment he saw a large triangle
on a poster and spat to one side as he
passed. “The symbol of the masons,” said
he. “To-day the Cross is fighting the triangle,
that is one meaning of the war. Do
you know, many of the stewards of the old
vodka shops were secretly masons, and it
was found that they cut out on the floor underneath
the shop counters, a cross&mdash;so that
the drunkards might trample it under foot.”
Yevgeny’s large intellectual face with
wizened white eyebrows, and fine eyes at the
bottom of caverns of wrinkled flesh, was
full of animation, his gap-toothed mouth
blurted the long torrent of words which it
could hardly control, his long black gown
from neck to ankles flapped in the wind.</p>

<p>I was sorry to have to part with him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>again so soon. But I promised to re-find
him when I returned to Moscow. He came
with me to the Kursky station. “God
meant that we should meet again,” said he.
“It was a miracle. All my life is full of
miracles.” He told me the miracles of his
birth. His mother was one of the serfs.
She married, but was eight years childless.
This caused her great grief, and she did not
cease to pray to God that she might bear a
child. “If it be a boy, he shall be either
a soldier or a monk,” she promised God.
Interesting that she should feel that to be a
soldier was also to be consecrated to God.
Yevgeny was born, and when he grew up he
volunteered to be a soldier, and went to
fight the Turks. He was wounded, and as
he lay on the battlefield in great pain, and
facing death, he promised his life to God.
He then rapidly recovered, and, fulfilling
his promise, entered a monastery. Since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>then all his life he has allowed himself to
be guided by visions and inspirations rather
than by reason.</p>

<p>In the vague light in the train, all the
passengers were quarrelling over places,
and the porters were struggling with baskets
and bundles. The old monk stood on
the grey platform and embraced me very
warmly, and then I stepped up, and the
third bell tinkled and the whistle blew, and
the train slowly ran out&mdash;leaving Yevgeny
at the far end of the platform and the space
of unoccupied rails behind the train, momentarily
increasing.</p>

<span class="small">A RUSSIAN COUNTESS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I made</span> a journey into the depths of
one of the central provinces and visited
Countess X. She had been in England
when the war broke out, and before she
could get back to Russia her husband had
volunteered and had already been taken
prisoner by the Germans. In her it was
possible to visualise something of the personal
tragedy of the war. A charming and
rather beautiful woman, the war commenced
when she was on the threshold of
life, when, as she said, life seemed to promise
so much. She is only thirty-four, and is
yet white-haired and deaf and feels herself
becoming older every month. “When my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>husband comes back he will find me an old
woman.”</p>

<p>Both she and her husband belong to the
old nobility of Russia; in the library face
themselves old paintings of her ancestor and
his, both conspirators in the plot to murder
Paul I, both expelled from St. Petersburg
of that day and ordered to live on their
estates, where it is said they did not behave
too sweetly to their serfs. The present
Count is an idealist, an admirer of the great
idealistic classics of Russian literature, a
man who loves the peasants, and ordinarily
spends most of his time on his estates. The
Countess deplored the sort of men he would
bring into dinner, knowing not the usage
of the knife, drinking the water of the finger-bowls,
and what-not, but country manners
never touched him&mdash;he simply did not
see what was being done.</p>

<p>When war broke out he was in such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>hurry to get to the front that he accepted a
commission in some town regiment where,
as a rule, the nobility do not figure, and he
went forward on the great wave of Russian
enthusiasm which led to Tannenberg.
There he was taken prisoner with many
thousand others, and was removed into the
depths of Germany. As a prisoner he
made an attempt to escape, but was arrested
before he reached the frontier. For this
offence he was put in a fortress in Saxony
and confined for a long time solitarily.
But he was not treated too badly by the
Germans and was given pens and paper and
books. He wrote to the Countess for one of
my books, of which there had been considerable
talk before the war. That was my
“Russian Pilgrims.” The Countess had
bought a copy, lent it to Mme. S., who had
passed it on to the Grand Duchess Elizabeth,
and they had all found it interesting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>It was sent to Count X. in Germany and he
translated it. It was rather touching from
my point of view to know that a Russian
prisoner had spent so many solitary hours
with me, working at a book I wrote.
When my “Martha and Mary” was published
he had that book also sent to him and
he translated it, and wrote so much about
the consolation that the Countess averred
she felt jealous of my name occurring
so often in his letters. Unfortunately,
“Martha and Mary” had already been
translated.</p>

<p>The Countess disapproved of her husband’s
idealism and would rather have had
him of a more careless worldly type. She
craved life, not merely ideas, and was afraid
that the sedentary life of her husband in the
fortress would so tell on his mind that when
he came back he would be less practical than
ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“Life is going to be good,” he wrote. “I
have not known till now what possibilities
it held, what wisdom there was in men, what
beauty. All will begin again when I come
back to Mother-of-God village” (the place
where his land is situated). “I want to re-read
all our poets. Their voices are going
to sound again. Do you know Solovyof?
He is wise and tender and beautiful. When
I come back I will not stray from Mother-of-God
village, not to Petrograd or to Moscow.
But we will sit together and read
Solovyof; you shall read him aloud to me
and I will be content....”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I dread that,” said the Countess.
“I should not want to sit and read
Solovyof. I want to live for my boy at
least. We cannot go on living here if my
boy is to be educated properly. But then&mdash;you
know what Tolstoy said to women,
‘Never use your influence with your husbands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
to make them act contrary to their
convictions.’ Do you agree to that? I do
not. I use all the influence I have.</p>

<p>“Life has been a great disillusion for me.
It promised so much. Once I used to think
there was nothing more wonderful than
what life was going to bring. Now I see it
is empty. There is nothing coming. Then
the war goes on from week to week and
month to month, interminably and without
any gleam of hope of an end. It is very
well to say the war will end by Christmas,
next Christmas next again. I do not believe
it. My boy is thirteen, delicate, enthusiastic,
excitable, and already he is experiencing
the emotion of love. He lost
his heart lately to one of his cousins. She
is twenty and is somewhat amused. The
other day he picked up my hand and kissed
it, which was somewhat unusual, and I
turned to him. There were tears in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>eyes and he looked up at me and said, ‘Ah,
mother, how sorry I am it is not Vera’s
hand.’ Galling, was it not?”</p>

<p>The Countess, for all her inward sadness
and her deafness, was extremely vivacious,
and when she did not hear she imagined
what you said and was very often right.
“I am sorry if sometimes I do not hear,” she
said. “Teach me to speak to you so that
you will hear,” said I, which is a simple sentence
but a suggestive thought.</p>

<p>An interesting and sad time I spent with
the Countess. Her quiet tragedy, that of
being robbed of a husband and robbed of
precious time, is part of the great universal
tragedy of war, which touches rich and poor
alike, simple and noble. The war has come
athwart many promising lives in this generation
and robbed the whole of the past and
of the future of all mortal significance.
Still, it has also given spiritual treasure in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>the heart, in the soul, hidden treasure&mdash;that
is what we must not overlook.</p>

<p>A letter which I have just received from
the poor prisoner gives the following
thoughts:</p>

<p>“Your book has changed much in my
conception of life. I was too Martha.
These last two years of captivity have been
a pilgrimage for me though I have stayed
in one place. Still I console myself by
thinking that if I am suffering others also
are, when I should, on the contrary, remember
that what happens to me happens to
no one else.</p>

<p>“I have just been told that my translations
may not be sent out of Germany, but
I hear that one book will soon appear in
Russia. It will be good for Russians to
read it now.</p>

<p>“You are right saying that we shall be
mad with joy at our relief. I cannot yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>feel myself free spiritually in prison, and
for me the body’s freedom is still the greatest
thing on earth, but I think of the day of
deliverance as something so remote and so
beautiful that I compare it with our resurrection
from death.”</p>

<span class="small">RUSSIAN LITERATURE IN 1916</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I read</span>, as ever, a great number of contemporary
Russian books, spent many hours in
bookshops, and it may not be out of place
to give my impression of the literature of
the hour.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the great emotional impulse
of the opening of the war in Russia has
passed. This is reflected very clearly in
current literature. The flood of printed
lectures, war-pamphlets, and poems has
ceased. Volumes of war stories are no
longer printed, and indeed the war as a literary
topic has become of minor interest.
In the clearance it is now possible to observe
the great desolation which the war has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>wrought. There is a strange silence in Russia.
What was before the war has passed;
what shall be after has not begun to be.
There is as yet no promise of the future anywhere.</p>

<p>Not that books have not been published
in 1916. They have been published thickly,
despite the absence of genius, the scarcity of
paper, and the supposed dearth of readers.
Fonvisin gets into her eighteenth thousand
with “Innocent and Yet to Blame,” and
“The Keys of Happiness” goes into the sixth
sequel. “The End of the War,” a novel by
Lef Zhdanof, runs through several editions.
“Russian Master,” an enthralling yellow-back
of 470 pages by Lappo-Danilevsky, is
reprinted many times. The translation of
the novels of W. J. Locke flood over every
bookseller’s counter and railway station
book-stall. New books are certainly as
plentiful as ever. But they are mostly interim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
volumes whose object is to pass the
time away till the clamour of the war be
over.</p>

<p>Gorky, who appears more and more as
an editor and essayist, has issued a volume
of translated Armenian literature, but he
is putting forth no creative artistic work,
and perhaps finds little time for it. As a
reward, however, politically-minded Radical
Russia certainly looks to him for light
and leading. Andreef goes on writing, but
seems to have fallen into minor importance.
Viacheslaf Ivanof has just written an excellent
book of essays on Dostoevsky, Solovyof,
Tolstoy, etc., which ought to be
translated into English together with his
former book “From Star to Star.” Artsibashef
continues to write salacious stories
for the Russian middle-class, and seems to
reflect their life and mind. Igor Severanin
is quiescent, but his latest volume of poems,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>printed on bad paper, is dedicated to his
“Thirteenth,” by which he apparently
means his thirteenth “lady friend.” A
curious volume lately confiscated by the
police is “Father Leontius and his Lady
Admirers,” an account of Rasputin, written
in the form of a fictitious narrative by a
serious student of sectarianism
and religious phenomena&mdash;Prugavin. The
society ladies circle round Leontius and cry
out “Alleluia!” “Sabaoth!” “Three in
One and One in Three!” which seems very
shocking and novel to Russians, though it
only reminds the English reader of the
Agapemonites at Clapton and similar phenomena.
Greater than the problem of the
psychology of Leontius seems to be the
problem of the psychology of the refined
and normal women who can hail him as
God. Lef Zhdanof’s popular novel on the
war is very friendly to the German people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>and gives them a new chance after a political
revolution. Balmont, the popular poet,
has written an essay in one volume entitled
“Poetry as Magic,” and parts are highly
reminiscent of Stevenson’s “Art of Writing.”
He analyses the functions of the letters
of the alphabet: <i>L</i> is a caress; <i>o</i> is space
triumphant; <i>u</i> is the music of noise, the
cry of terror; <i>m</i> is man shutting his lips, it
is all the dumb can say in their anguish,
etc.</p>

<p>Walter Pater is being translated, and
seems to be appreciated by cultured Russians,
though it is a pity that only fragments
and not the whole of his masterpiece
“Marius the Epicurean” are appearing in
the collection of his works. There is certainly
a great demand for English books,
and our literature remains in vogue. And
books about England have been appearing,
the latest being Nabokof’s account of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>visit with the journalists. It is somewhat
inadequate as an account of England, but
then it pretends to reflect only the impressions
of this officially guided tour. Nabokof
seems to have been greatly impressed by
Sir Edward Grey as a new type of diplomatist,
a man whose strength lies in the fact
that he is always a gentleman and tells the
simple truth. Chukovsky’s book, “The Silent
Ones have Spoken,” on the British
Tommy is popular. Incidentally it may be
remarked that Chukovsky, who made such
an impression in England, is a journalistic
critic of a penetrative quality. His “From
Chekhof to our Days,” though containing
some things impossible to print in English,
is yet a very clever book. A new correspondent
of some ability is now representing
the <i>Russkoe Slovo</i> in England and giving
a more representative account of our
life than the old school of academic Radicals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
who usually represent Russian newspapers
abroad.</p>

<p>Rozanof’s book on the war, “The War
and the Popular Awakening,” has been out
of print for some time, and presumably his
publisher has no paper. Novikof’s popular
novel on the present point of view with
regard to the Revolution is also unobtainable.
Many good books of previous years
have not been reprinted through the dearness
or scarcity of paper. On the other
hand, certain more obscure publishers who
have managed to hoard up paper can carry
on their business in full swing. The chief
commercial event of the year in the literary
world has been the purchase by Seetin of
the <i>Niva</i>, the extremely popular weekly.
As Seetin already owns the <i>Russkoe Slovo</i>
and several other papers and literary enterprises,
he is becoming somewhat of a literary
king, an interesting figure in modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>Russia, for he started life as a peasant, became
an itinerant hawker of penny books
for the people, and is now a man of great
power in Russia.</p>

<p>M. Protopopof, now Minister of the Interior,
a man of large commercial interests,
is now, backed by certain banks (previously
of a strong German complexion but now
said to be decently metamorphosed), starting
a large new Petrograd newspaper (name
not yet decided). There were many blunders
in the advertisement of this newspaper
enterprise. It was stated that Korolinko
would be editor and that Léonid
Andreef and many other popular writers
would contribute. But Korolinko fought
shy of it and the other writers one by one
disclaimed interest in the publication.
Maxim Gorky was asked to edit it but
found out apparently that it was not revolutionary
in tendency, was capitalist rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>than labour, and that the object was international
trade prosperity, and he withdrew
entirely. Now A. V. Amphiteatrof, the
Italian correspondent of the <i>Russkoe Slovo</i>
and author of a great number of curiously
interesting historical studies, is to be the
editor. He is an Italophile and favours
much more friendly relationship between
Italy and Russia; in politics he may be said
to be Radical and has got into trouble with
the Government upon occasion. It will be
interesting to see whether the enormous capital
behind this paper will give it the chance
of success that the same amount of capital
behind a new paper in England would give.
In Russia large capital is considered fair
prey by all who can get itching fingers near
it.</p>

<p>These notes give an indication of literary
currents and tendencies in the autumn of
1916, in the midst of the war. It should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>be added that, despite the great rise in prices
of all things in Russia, the price of books
remains almost as cheap as ever. Reading
certainly increases, and consequently makes
the general cost of publication less. The
most characteristic of the new war phenomena
of Russia is still the cry “<i>Gazette,
Gazette!</i>” flung up at the trains from the
fields wherever you travel. You are asked
to throw your old newspapers out of the
train window, that the people in the villages
may read them. This cry will hardly
die down when the war is over. But will
the gazette satisfy? Will not books have
to follow, and more substantial, better books,
because of what the peasants have learned
from reality? Russia is waiting for new
national writers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An interesting phenomenon in the life of
contemporary Russia is the position taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>up by Maxim Gorky as a challenger of the
national and traditional ideas in Russian
life and literature. He has become the
spokesman of a considerable number of
working men and middle-class Russians,
but has at the same time brought upon his
head the wrath not only of old-fashioned
people but of a great number of liberal and
progressive thinkers. His campaign began
when he returned to Russia at the beginning
of 1914 and launched his attack on
Dostoevsky. The war seemed to cause a
lull in his activities, but last winter he resumed
his verbal warfare with more energy
than ever. His point of view is, that
Dostoevsky is bad for Russia, because his
outlook was concentrated on suffering and
death. Russia must turn her back resolutely
on Dostoevsky and seek life. Russia
must cease to be mystical, suffering, melancholy,
and must become clear-minded and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>mistress of her soul. The challenge raised
a great clamour. At first not many sided
with him; but since the appearance of
“Two Souls”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>  and “A Letter to the
Reader”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>  in the journal <i>Lietopis</i> it becomes
evident that he has some following.
He has raised a question, and many
Russians are considering it for the first
time.</p>


<p>The Russian which Gorky attacks is just
that which is spiritually interesting to us
in England&mdash;the mystical and unpractical
Russia. Russia on pilgrimage, artistic Russia;
and that which he wants Russia to be
is just what would have least spiritual interest
for us&mdash;Russia optimistic, cocksure,
businesslike, well-dressed, smart, and Western.
He writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Russian seeking-after-God comes
from an insufficiency of conviction in the
force of reason&mdash;from the need of a weak
man to find some guiding will outside himself.</p>

<p>“The turning to mysticism and romantic
fantasies is a turning towards stagnation,
and is contrary to the interests of a young
democracy, poisoning and enfeebling it,
giving it a passive attitude towards reality,
and suggesting doubt in the force of reason....</p>

<p>“The mind of the ancient East weighs
most heavily and murderously on our Russian
life, and has an influence immeasurably
deeper on our psychology than on that of
Western Europe....</p>

<p>“We Russians have two souls; one, derived
from the wandering Mongol, is that of
the dreamer, mystic, idler, believer in fate;
the other is the soul of the Slav, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
could burn up bravely and clearly, but cannot
because of the other.”</p>
</div>

<p>One may reasonably question the correctness
of this differentiation, seeing that
when we scratch a Russian we do not find
a dreamer. We should be inclined to say
exactly the reverse; that the gentle, dreaming,
poetic soul was that of the Slav&mdash;and
that Gorky would find the educated Tartar
considerably nearer his ideal than any characteristic
Slav.</p>

<p>The article entitled “Two Souls” made
a considerable stir, the magazine went
quickly out of print, and a great number
of criticisms were made in the Press and
on the platform. Their general tone was
that Gorky was out of his true medium and
had better go back to his art. As a result
Gorky wrote “A Letter to the Reader” as
a sort of collective answer to “the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>or less ironical or angry comments of my
colleagues of the pen,” and sarcastically
quoted Lescov: “On the Russian people
it is good to look from afar, especially when
he prays and believes”; and he went on
to excuse his being “a bad publicist” and
to plead that his words should have weight
as being those of one who had lived through
a great deal and knew Russian life at least
as well as any of his opponents.</p>

<p>In this reply he exhibited a rather curious
attitude towards Anglo-Russian friendship
which it would be well for English
people to note&mdash;a belief that we seek friendship
with Russia merely to exploit her materially
and to keep her in a commercial
bondage similar to that which she has suffered
from the Germans.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Russian philosophers argue in this
way (says Gorky). The alliance with England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
is worthy of the greatness of the Russian
people because it will lead to the union
of the nations under the standard of the
true spiritual culture of the mystical East.
There are only two world Powers&mdash;Russia
and England. And these two States have,
as the foundation of their power, the lands
and peoples of the religious East, rather
than of the materialistic West. To these
two is the problem of uniting culturally India,
China, Japan. And when this union
of the peoples of the mystic East takes place,
the earth will be given ultimate liberty in
peace. But for that end it is necessary that
Russia keep true to her mission and establish
her culture upon the mystical revelations
leading to peace and love.”</p>
</div>

<p>But Gorky bids these philosophers be
undeceived. It is no use, he says, their
getting rid of German capitalists simply to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>make way for English ones. That was what
English friendship meant. Such a book,
for instance, as “The Way of Martha and
the Way of Mary” met with so much approval
because in picturing us as holy lazy-bones
and unpractical persons it allowed the
English capitalist to rub his hands with
glee, seeing in Russia a future British colony
such as Africa or India. Whilst Russia
is in her present state, friendship with
any European Power must be the friendship
of the earthenware pot and the iron kettle.
Russia has to fight not for “ultimate liberty,”
but for the simplest civil rights as
citizens. We must try to give the people
education and try to train their will toward
life.</p>

<p>No doubt Gorky makes an appeal in
these words; and if the average Russian
were asked what were the foundations of
Anglo-Russian friendship apart from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>needs of the war, he would answer, Commercial
exploitation. Trade, it is true, is
put jealously forward as something to be
captured after the war; but it seems a pity
that Russians should not realise the depth,
the sincerity of our interest in their characteristic
religion, literature, and life.
Whatever political tendency our interest
may help, it is nevertheless true that England
obtains from Russia spiritual help; and
a great deal of that which Gorky condemns
in his own nation is coming to our help to
redeem us from commercialism and materialism.
It is something of a paradox that
the bright spirits of Russia should hate the
melancholy vistas of Tambof and Kaluga
and that the bright spirits of England should
hate the gloom of Newcastle and Leeds,
that one should look with love from England
to the wandering pilgrims of Tambof
and the other should sigh for the clamour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>of wheels where “man at least is master.”
But paradox is tolerable where misunderstanding
is not. For paradoxes abound in
truth, and truth is made up of such paradoxes.</p>

<p>Later on in his essay Gorky remarks that
stormy and revolutionary eras have produced
great men, and his first example is
Shakespeare, who flourished “in the stormy
time of Queen Elizabeth.” But rather,
they were “spacious days”; and great men,
great thoughts are almost always born in
spacious days, halcyon days, when the dove
broods on waters. Strength is with calmness,
not with noise and quarrellings and
revolutions. The critics are probably right
when they say, “Return to Art.” Art is
creative, whereas argument is generally destructive.
And Maxim Gorky evidently
wishes to create.</p>

<p>Maxim Gorky may be called the leader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>of the <i>porazhentsi</i>, the people who believe
in defeat. He has lately added to “Two
Souls” and “A Letter to the Reader”&mdash;the
“Letters of William Simpleton, a Knowing
Stranger.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>  But it is what we call
“half-baked.” Gorky has read an enormous
number of books since he tucked his blouse
inside and became respectable, but it is difficult
to see where he, or the reader, has
profited. He does not know where he is.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
<span class="small">RUSSIA IN 1916</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> in Russia at the beginning of the war
and during the first months of conflict, and
I witnessed the superb enthusiasm with
which she rose to fight. Again I was in
Russia last year, when, owing to the general
shortage of shells west and east, Germany
was able to turn her superiority to
account by retaking Galicia and ravaging
Poland, and I saw the humiliation almost
amounting to despair of Russia then. And
therefore returning once more to Russia in
June, 1916, I could form a fairly just idea
of the spirit of Russia to-day.</p>

<p>Last autumn, returning from Russia, I
was bound to say I found Russia pessimistic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>and though it is really bad form to be pessimistic,
personally I certainly felt so myself.
But all has gone well in the intervening
period, and when I reached Russia
this year I found her remarkably cheerful.
My impression is that the Russians have settled
down to a long war. It may last three
or four years more, but they do not intend
to worry. After the period of depression
they are brightly optimistic again. Perhaps
some are too optimistic and rely on mysterious
prophecies as to the war finishing by
Christmas, or think that the German people
will revolt and give us an easy victory
against a divided kingdom. One thing may
be observed: the great work of French and
English on the western front is now fully
reported in the Russian Press. There are
on an average two or three columns about
us in the Russian newspaper. The Havas
Agency is quoted, the <i>Times</i>, the <i>Manchester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Guardian</i>, the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>, and
other papers, very fully. It is possible for
an Englishman in Russia to form a fair
idea of each day’s news, so the Russian also
can grasp it. That is a splendid improvement
on last year when we got only those
laconic non-committal communiqués which
our smart English journalists can cause to
blossom with occult significance for our
English newspapers, but which in very truth
translated into Russian merely gave the impression
that we were doing nothing.</p>

<p>Russia feels us closer. The distance
across is not so great. Day by day every
one feels that we are all working happily
together for one end and with one interest.</p>

<p>The visits of the journalists and the parliamentarians
to the West have also helped
a great deal. The journalists wrote their
impressions very fully and expressed
themselves with great enthusiasm. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>contributions on the subject lingered on
throughout the summer. And now they are
collecting their articles and re-issuing them
in book form. Nabokof’s “From Militant
England” has already had considerable success.
Lectures have also been given. The
members of the Duma and the Senate came
back imbued with our enthusiasm, Radical
and Conservative alike, and what they saw
of our work was luminous in debate. On
the whole the Russians have become much
more warm and friendly towards us. They
are obtaining a better understanding of our
ideals, our character and national determination.</p>

<p>After the defeats of last autumn there
sprang up a sort of intellectual sect, the
<i>porazhentsi</i>, people who believe in defeat.
These held that Russia stood to gain more
by being beaten than by winning&mdash;a conclusion
that the Russian soul is more ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>to accept than we should be. Brusilof’s
victories seem, however, to have dissipated
this doctrine for the time being, and the
<i>porazhentsi</i> are little heard of this autumn.</p>

<p>Allied to this, however, has been a more
important movement in favour of a self-dependent
Russia. Why should Russia
struggle out of German commercial bondage
merely to fall into British hands? Why
cannot she manufacture for herself, be
enough unto herself in all departments?
This sentiment has been very widespread.
Russia has obtained the impression that the
striving toward Russian friendship going on
for many years before the war has been
primarily with the idea of capturing Russian
trade. Whereas as a matter of fact the
impulse for friendship came first of all from
literary and artistic England, then from
England as a whole, and the business men
were the camp-followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>The question of Russia and trade needs
very careful treatment in the Press. The
phrase “exploiting Russia after the war” is
obnoxious and almost devoid of real meaning.
Many small merchants will be led to
try and <i>exploit</i> Russia after the war and will
simply burn their fingers. All trade with
Russia must be carefully arranged on broad
principles to benefit both countries equally
as before the war. Russia is the great producing
country of the world and she needs
a world market for her products&mdash;that Britain
can obtain for her and that will be for
the health of Russia and of the world. In
return we shall send much to Russia, but not
haphazard, and not shoddy dump, I hope.</p>

<p>Russian trade of all kinds is in a bad way
just now and it is a trying time for Russian
merchants&mdash;especially when they read frequently
in their newspapers “Britain’s Record
Month of Trade,” and the like. I think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>these joyful telegrams about our trade
should be accompanied by an explanatory
note to the effect that the greater part of that
so-called trade is a matter of war materials
and necessities. The figures really represent
our tremendous activity in the Allied
cause. War is a material waste, and every
moment it is prolonged we lose heavily <i>materially</i>.
And in this material sense we lose
more than Russia loses. We have had more
to lose. Our trade figures represent the
height of our temperature in the war-fever.</p>

<p>Russia is suffering internally through the
fact that she has had only two open ports of
value&mdash;Archangel and Vladivostock&mdash;and
she cannot import the manufactures she
needs. The railways and the ships are
needed for the transport of munitions and
food for the Army. The Army comes first,
the war comes first, and everything else must
give way. The people in the background
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>have a real share in the privations of the
war. Disorganisation amounts at times to
dislocation, owing to war needs. But the
Russians bear things cheerily. All manner
of new economic phenomena appear, and the
Russians try measure after measure to remedy
the troubles.</p>

<p>Practically every man of military age
throughout the vast empire is either fighting
or training. Before the  war many had
used influence to avoid military service, had
obtained medical exemption on the slightest
grounds. But there has been a thorough
revision, and large numbers have been recovered.
You see the new troops marching
and drilling on the open places of the
large towns, in camps on the steppes, and as
the train takes you through the country you
see boy-Cossacks prancing about on their
ponies and practising with their lances.</p>

<p>Russia is altogether in the war and for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>the war. She is doing her utmost. And
her spirit is good. It is well English people
should feel that to-day. And from us
should go out to this great people, suffering
and struggling as we are, a great fellow-feeling
of gratitude and generous affection.</p>

<span class="small">RUSSIAN MONEY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> the war for £10 you received 94
roubles, but now you receive 150. Last
year after the great Russian retreat the exchange
stood at over 160, but banks refused
to give more than a nominal exchange.
And in order to stop traffic abroad and foreign
speculation in Russian money it was
forbidden by law for any one to take more
than 500 roubles out of the country. Now,
however, the new value of the rouble seems
to have been accepted, and banks generally
give the due exchange value. Although the
rouble has slightly improved it is not anticipated
that the paper money will ever regain
its guaranteed gold exchange. Each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>Russian note is in the form of a certificate
that the State Bank will pay in exchange for
it a certain quantity of gold. That certificate
has little value to-day, and it is an open
secret that the Government buys gold at a
rate which assumes a lower value for the
rouble. People who have hoards of gold
coinage&mdash;and they are many in Russia, for
the people are disinclined to use banks&mdash;are
keeping their gold, and their action is justified
by the privileges which are already
accorded those who can pay the Government
in coin. It is expected by many that at the
end of the war the rouble will be assigned
a lower gold value.</p>

<p>One obvious effect of the depreciation of
the rouble has been that all real estate and
material belongings have increased in money
value. If you have an estate worth 94,000
roubles before the war, it is now worth 150,000
roubles, and you are lucky if your fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
was in this comparatively more real
form, of land. People, on the other hand,
who were in debt have found the actual
weight of the debt diminishing as money
lost value. This has been particularly noticeable
in the case of people who have mortgaged
property. Suddenly it has been possible
to sell the property at a high figure,
pay off the debt, and still retain an unexpectedly
large margin.</p>

<p>My friends the M.s have long wished
to sell their large house in Vladikavkaz,
but have held its value at what was in the
old days an absurdly high figure. People
used to laugh when the price was mentioned.
But this year, “as if by miracle,” to use my
friends’ phrase, a purchaser turned up,
agreed to their price and completed the
transaction in six hours. He was pleased
and they were pleased. “What sort of a
man was he?” I asked. “Oh, a sort of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>Tartar,” they replied. He made a long way
the better bargain, for he understood to what
extent the rouble had lost value. On the
other hand my friends paid off a big debt
with these depreciated roubles, and there
also they gained.</p>

<p>The people who have made money by
the war are busy buying land and houses.
This is reproachfully called land speculation,
but is in reality commonsense action on
the part of those who wish to make fast their
wealth. When I paid a visit to Kislovodsk
in the Caucasus, an extremely popular watering
place in the mountains, I found a
perfect rage of buying and selling property,
brought about by this elementary change in
values.</p>

<p>The public are still exhorted to pay for
their railway tickets in gold, but are less
inclined to do so than ever. There is reason
to believe that there are a number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>millions of gold coins being hoarded in the
country. Friends have shown me their private
supplies. When one reads of burglaries,
there is often a mention of several hundreds
of roubles in gold being stolen.</p>

<p>In the southern districts of the Empire
German agents have appeared, offering 15
roubles paper for 10 roubles gold. In this
way Germany is said to have collected a
considerable amount of Russian gold. The
traffic was discovered by the police in Russian
Central Asia, where men were found
to be carrying this gold into Persia and
thence to Turkey and Germany in small
hand-bags. Many arrests were made, including
that of M. Poteliakhof, a rich Bokhara
Jew and dealer in cotton, who was
found to be deep in this nefarious trade.</p>

<p>Russia has no gold in circulation, but also
she has no silver and no copper. Russian
silver coinage became last year, at least in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>popular estimation, worth its weight in silver,
and people began hoarding it; copper
also was hoarded, and after the retreat from
the Carpathians there were a series of small-change
panics in the towns in the background.
Many shops were sacked because
the shopkeepers refused to give change; people
travelled free on the trams because the
conductors could not change their rouble
notes. On other occasions you were obliged
to accept sticky postage stamps as change.
Thorough Government action swiftly followed,
and paper tokens for all the small
coins were introduced. Postage stamps
without gummy backs were issued for 10,
15 and 20 copecks, a shilling note (50 copecks)
was issued, and slips were printed
for 1, 2, 3 and 5 copecks. How filthy this
money became may be imagined. People
gave it to beggars saying, “I give you this
not because I pity your state, but because the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>money is so dirty.” Still this new paper
was accepted without riots, and the people
soon realised that it was more convenient
than “sounding” money, and that five roubles’
worth of it could be put in a small
purse without adding a considerable weight
to one’s pockets. Thoughtful people welcomed
it as teaching the ignorant that money
had no value in itself, but only as a token of
exchange. To-day one never sees a silver
piece in Russia. All is being hoarded.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the war and the substitution
of paper for coin has taught some
people to care less for money. The Russian
word is <i>dengy</i>, which is really a Tartar
word. Indeed, where money is concerned
the Russian is a bit of a Tartar and loves
to feel the metal between his hands. If a
substantial sum is mentioned, he nods his
head and exclaims, “That is money!” as if
he could see it being emptied out with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>joyous clash on the table in front of him.
Of course the people who see money that
way always see it in small quantities. The
Russian business man is crafty over small
deals. I imagine his money sense fails him
more or less in very large deals and financial
operations. To the true financier money
must be somewhat of an abstraction and high
finance a sort of higher thought.</p>

<span class="small">WITHOUT VODKA, BEER, OR WINE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a great difference throughout the
land, something unmistakable, and you
cannot say that it is undefinable, you know
at once what it is. Vodka has disappeared.
Beer has gone. Wines are sold at the chemists’
only on presentation of a medical certificate
endorsed by the police. So far from
relaxing, the liquor prohibition vigilance
has been increased, and districts to which
the Tsar’s original <i>ukase</i> did not apply, such
as Russian Central Asia, have been taken in.
You see smart officers sitting down to a bottle
of <i>citro</i>, and it is rather a surprise that
they do not grumble. Male complexions
generally are becoming less red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>As a result of over two years’ temperance,
violent crime has practically disappeared
from whole countrysides, and when occasionally
some brutality has occurred, the police
have managed to bring to book not only
the direct offender, but also the person who
was secretly brewing the liquor. The spirit
of peace has come into the industrial or mining
village on the Sunday and Saint’s Day,
where formerly there were often scenes of
outrageous public hooliganism on the part of
whole populations. Money has increased
in the pockets of the poor. There is a
higher standard of living; butter is being
spread on the black bread. Peasant families
are enjoying the eggs which formerly
they would have sold for the money to buy
drink. One of the reasons given for the
shortage of food supplies in the great towns
is that owing to the fact that the peasants
find nothing on which to spend their money
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>they will not sell their produce. Formerly
they could buy vodka. Infant mortality is
already very much on the decrease. On the
whole, children seem better cared for,
though Russian peasants are always inclined
to be rather careless of these gifts of God.
There is an outbreak of “fashions” in the
village, and if you ask your cook or serving-maid
she will tell you how cottons are being
cut this year, though the details seem to
have little reference to <i>modes de Paris</i>.
There is a popular joke that the peasant
women make a mistake in the word they
employ for fine dresses. “Just look at the
<i>snariadi</i> (shells) I am wearing,” when they
mean to use the word nariadi, a townspeople’s
word for Sunday best.</p>

<p>There would also be much new reading
in the village but for the fact that for the
peasant there is as yet a dearth of printed
matter. Children are sent to cry out to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>passing trains for newspapers, and one finds
the wisps of old papers in one’s carriage and
throws them on to the wind. They are
eagerly picked up.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the people are more
active, less sluggish, particularly in the
towns. There is an unwonted amount of
energy in play. The suppression of vodka
is good, but it would be absurd to say that
the energies unleashed are entirely on the
side of good. The old Adam can express
itself in many ways. The wrong impulse
merely prevented is not excised, it breaks
out in another place. There is more gambling,
more unrestrained sexual sin. I suppose
no Tsar’s <i>ukase</i> could clean up the
Nevsky Prospect or Tverskaya, or stop love
affairs with other men’s wives. But even
if it could the sinful impulse would break
out somewhere else with perhaps greater
vigour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>I have been over thousands of miles of
Russia this year, in town and in village, in
the melancholy north and in the passionate
south, and I can give authentic witness.
There is no noticeable leak of vodka. Except
in Archangel city, I saw no drunken
man anywhere. There they were drunk
with English whisky obtained from the
boats in the harbour. The pilot taking
boats out always expects a bottle of whisky
as well as his three-rouble tip. All manner
of people are, as a British captain expressed
it, “bumming around for whisky.” I believe
it is now probable that ships bound for
Archangel will only be allowed to take a
limited supply in future. Poor thirsty Russians,
one can easily understand the wiles
of those who think they can get it at Archangel!</p>

<p><i>Shinkarstvo</i>, or illicit distilling and sale,
has, it is true, broken out, as M. Kokofstef
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>predicted when opposing the local option
measure before the war. Alcoholic substitutes
are prepared and sold in small quantities.
There were several hundred prosecutions
during the past year. But the police
seem to have the suppression of this <i>shinkarstvo</i>
well in hand.</p>

<p>Some incurables have taken to methylated
spirit, eau de Cologne, furniture polish, and
some have died in consequence.</p>

<p>My impression is that enforced temperance
in alcoholic drink is going to be permanent
in Russia&mdash;at least as far as the
Tsar’s reign is concerned. National sobriety
is one of the ideals of the Tsar. It is
not a temporary measure. Licences may be
granted after the war on certain conditions,
and the rich may have their wines again.
But popular drinking is not likely to be reestablished
unless some business Government
should ever get into power having big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>alcoholic interests. But business governments
are not likely there.</p>

<p>The chief gain to Russia from a military
point of view must undoubtedly be held to
be the great increase of efficiency in the nation.
Their warm sociality always betrayed
them heretofore. In Russian character and
temperament the elimination of strong drink
has not had the effect which it might be expected
to have if introduced in this country.
Here our efficiency, which is becoming
higher than before, would probably be little
affected by prohibition, but personal character
and outlook on life would be changed
beyond doubt.</p>

<p>I have had to answer publicly several letters
on the subject of Russian Prohibition
and I append one letter and answer as perhaps
helpful generally. I am constantly
asked to refute false statements concerning
the sale of alcoholic liquor in Russia, but as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>replies take time to write I feel that the
many temperance societies might well establish
vigilance committees to correct false
statements. A reference to the Russian
Consul-General in London on the subjects
generally elicits a simple confirmation of
what I write on the matter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><i>To the Editor of The Times.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your issue of the 8th inst. Mr.
Stephen Graham writes: ‘No wine or beer
... is obtainable in Russia except clandestinely,
as at Archangel.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Graham’s knowledge of Russia is
admittedly unique; he may be able to explain,
therefore, what is a puzzle to those
who are interested in the subject.</p>

<p>“I take from your Russian Section of
October 28 the following excerpts:</p>

<p>“<i>Page 6.</i>&mdash;‘The Imperial Duma, while
generally prohibiting the consumption of
liquors containing alcohol, adopted an indulgent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
attitude towards grape wine. On
July 14 (27), 1915, the Government imposed
upon grape wine a small excise at the
rate of 1 rouble 60 copeck per vedro. In
the case of grape wine, consumption amounts
to 40,000,000 vedros (120,000,000 gallons).’</p>

<p>“Then, again, referring to mild beer:</p>

<p>“‘This drink is supposed to contain not
more than 1-1/2 per cent. of alcohol, although
it is manufactured almost without Excise
inspection and might easily be made stronger.
The breweries are earning big profits
from the sale of this beverage, bigger even
than their former profits from beer; the
State itself gets nothing.’</p>

<p>“Again, in the Returns of State Revenue,
page 14, there is given as receipts in 1916
from Liquor Excise, 41,322,000 roubles in
1916, as against 18,084,000 roubles in 1915.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
<p>“Again, on page 15.&mdash;‘Profits of Liquor
Monopoly, 503,904,000 roubles in 1916,
as compared with 30,718,000 roubles in
1915.’</p>

<p>“Can Mr. Graham reconcile the total
prohibition which he affirms now obtains in
Russia with these excerpts, or are there
some errors in the figures which can be explained?</p>

<p class="right">“Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right2">“H&mdash;&mdash; S. K&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="no-indent">“&mdash;&mdash;,</p>

<p>“<i>November 9</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following answer was given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><i>To the Editor The Times.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is quite profitable to consider
Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;’s letter because of the blurred
notion of Russian temperance reform which
is prevalent in this country. It is most important
that whatever opinion we may hold
regarding enforced temperance or other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>questions, we should yet keep a clear picture
of the current life of our Allies.</p>

<p>“I am now just six weeks back in England
after a four months’ journey in which
I visited places so wide apart in the Russian
Empire as Ekaterina, in the far north, and
villages of the Central Caucasian range, in
the south; and I stayed a while in Petrograd
and Moscow, Rostof, Orel, and other considerable
cities, and I can say by the evidence
of my eyes that intoxicating liquor has
disappeared. The only drunken men I saw
were in Archangel. Officers to-day sit
down to talk over a bottle of <i>citro</i>. In the
restaurants you are given <i>kvas</i>, a sort of
fruity ginger-beer, which in truth is not
allowed to have more than 1-1/2 per cent. of
alcohol, and is in no sense a beer.</p>

<p>“The article in the Russian Section is by
the Petrograd Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>,
and consists chiefly of extracts from an article
by the Russian Professor Migulin. I
find the phrase in the translation is ‘malt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>beverage,’ and not ‘mild beer,’ as Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;
puts it; and I think it refers to a beverage
something like birch beer as sold in America,
a sort of empty symbol of beer taken not
because it is pleasant but because one must
order something with one’s meals. It has
no alcoholic reality, is sold in bottles, and
is of a standardised taste and quality.</p>

<p>“As regards wine, it must be remembered
that in the Caucasus, in Transcaucasia, and
in Russian Central Asia there are wine industries,
wine is the local popular drink, not
tea as in Russia proper. This wine is
usually kept in skins and sold in pots.
There is also a bottling industry, but the export
of this wine from these remote parts of
the Empire to Russia proper has been prohibited
except in cases of specially guaranteed
orders.</p>

<p>“I believe British and American and
other foreign subjects are allowed to purchase
wine for their private use on the
presentation of a certificate. Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Migulin appears to be advocating a State
monopoly in the sale of wine on the ground
that ‘only on condition of a State monopoly
would it be safe to allow the free circulation
of grape-wine; otherwise under the guise of
wine vodka will again make its appearance.’
For the phrase ‘grape wine’ read ‘grape
juice.’ Professor Migulin’s figures are apparently
incorrect&mdash;the population of Russia
is not consuming a gallon of grape-juice
per head in addition to what it drinks in the
way of <i>citro</i>, <i>kvas</i>, <i>narzan</i>, birch beer, etc.</p>

<p>“As regards the revenue returns, may I
make the following remarks:</p>

<p>“1. Although the sale of alcohol in the
form of drink has been abolished, the manufacture
continues in perhaps larger quantities.</p>

<p>“Enormous quantities have been exported
to France for use in the manufacture of high
explosives, and I do not need to say more
than that on the head of the extensive industrial
uses of alcohol.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
<p>“2. In the figures of profits of liquor
monopoly are included (<i>a</i>) debts recovered;
(<i>b</i>) sums brought in after the winding-up
of big shops where the accounts were not
simple; (<i>c</i>) sale of vodka in Russian Central
Asia and Transcaucasia (lately prohibited
in both these districts also); (<i>d</i>) sale
abroad; (<i>e</i>) the sale in Government shops
of Caucasian mineral waters, now very extensive.</p>

<p>“3. Under the heading Liquor Excise is
included the tax on mineral waters, grape-juice,
etc., tax on real wine in Central Asia
and Transcaucasia, on wine specially supplied
for foreign consumption, on wines allotted
to chemists for medical purposes, etc.</p>

<p>“4. The great increase in the returns is
due to the tax on non-alcoholic drinks and
Government sales.</p>

<p>“5. In these revenue returns the classification
and nomenclature is not scientific,
and the primary intention is to give a rough
guide to the figures of the Budget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“I hope these remarks do something to
clear away the doubt in the minds of students
of figures and papers. For the rest
I can only reiterate the evidence of my
eyes&mdash;Russia is without spirits, beer, or
wine, and, if I may add it, she does not feel
in any way persecuted or tyrannised over
because of it.</p>

It was so crowded this summer of
1916 that people slept in passages, in outhouses,
in ramshackle cupboards and bathhouse,
and paid fancy prices for the privilege.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Return seats in the trains were all
booked for two months ahead, and but for
“the loop-holes of escape” I should have
been forced to stay in the Caucasus until the
end of September.</p>

<p>Petrograd and Moscow being so desperately
serious in tone, many pleasure-lovers
decided to extend the summer season, and
even to try Kislovodsk as a winter resort.
There was lively speculation in rooms and
<i>datchas</i> with a view to high prices reigning
throughout the winter.</p>

<p>An unhealthy spot this Kislovodsk, the
air of its little streets heavy with the odour
of decay and dirt. It is in a valley and
there are glorious moors and hills about it.
But one never sees any visitor on the hills.
The visitors keep to the leafy promenades
in the park, within hearing of the music of
the bandstands and in reach of the café and
the ice-cream bar. The women are mostly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>in white, but more coarse of feature than in
most places in Russia&mdash;the faces of women
on a low level of intelligence, of the sort who
pride themselves on being “interesting” to
men. They wear their diamonds in the
afternoon. A lady was robbed of her
diamonds in broad daylight in Essentuki,
a neighbouring resort, and on being reproached
for wearing diamonds in wartime,
replied, “Where else should I show them
except at the waters?”</p>

<p>The people who have made fortunes out
of the war are prominent at Kislovodsk,
and the emptiness of their gay life is an
unpleasant contrast to the realities of the
time. Not the cultured of Russia, these,
not the noble and the wise, not the people
who really are the nation! Yet enter into
conversation with one of these commercial
parvenus and you find boundless vanity and
self-importance. “We are the people who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>count in Russia,” they say. Go into a restaurant
and your senses will be lacerated as
you see them all around you eating with
their knives. The books they are reading
are Artsibashef, Fonvizin, Verbitskaya.
Ask about the real artists of Russia and they
raise their eyebrows or express contempt.
They are nearest to the class in America that
invented the word “high-brow” and for
whom commercial talent must go on manufacturing
huge quantities of loathsome “low-brow”
literature, art, music and drama.</p>

<p>Many people asked me about England,
but I was obliged to say the spirit of England
would not tolerate a Kislovodsk; we
have nothing quite so shameless during the
war. We have people who are profiting by
death and destruction and calamity and sorrow,
but public opinion does not allow these
venal gains to be flaunted in this way.</p>

<p>At Russian theatres, as indeed in English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>theatres at home, flippant and indecent
farces, the theatres themselves going ahead
of the people and leading downward. One
thing we may generally surmise, comparing
one side of the footlights with the other&mdash;the
life of the people looking on is ten thousand
times better than the life presented
on the stage. The vulgar and cynical notions
expressed by the actors and actresses
are only regarded as curious or amusing or
spicily outrageous by the people who have
paid so much money for the doubtful privilege
of listening.</p>

<p>I witnessed a three-act play, translated
or adapted from the French, where there
was the usual dressing and undressing on
the stage and scampering about in undergarments.
Suddenly the lady who had
the most abominable part to play, in the
midst of one of the most unpleasant parts
clutched at her breast with her hand and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>fell with a loud thud on the stage. Then
the curtain came down. We waited. Presently
out came a weedy-looking pale-faced
commercial and made the following statement:</p>

<p>As Mme. A. has had a heart seizure we
cannot continue the performance. The
management, however, hope that the audience
will not on that account feel a grievance
or that the money ought to be returned.
To-night’s tickets will be available to-morrow
night, when a substitute will be found
for Mme. A.</p>

<p>At this there were angry shouts from all
over the theatre:</p>

<p>“What is the money to do with it?”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to see the wretched play
again.”</p>

<p>“How is her health?”</p>

<p>“Tell us how she is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>Some one else came out from behind the
curtain and asked:</p>

<p>“Is there a doctor here?”</p>

<p>A young woman at once came up. But
the audience left its seat and crowded forward
towards the curtain asking angrily
how the actress was. The actress was not
a particular favourite. But the people
cared, and what is more, they had been
made ashamed by the callous but sincere
statement of the management on the more
important aspect of the interruption of the
programme. Life on the stage and life,
how wide apart!</p>

<p>Intoxication through alcohol has disappeared,
and with it a certain amount of abnormal
and bestial vice, but the world remains
as evil and human.</p>

<p>Drink, as the porter in <i>Macbeth</i> said, is
the great equivocator, it sets on and sets off,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>persuades and then disheartens. The removal
of drink has left men more restless&mdash;at
least in the towns. Probably in the
village the removal of all kinds of drink
has been an unmixed blessing. But in the
towns the roving eye of man has roved further.
It is impossible to clear up the immorality
of the towns by Imperial <i>ukase</i>.
The Russian boy of the town is born into
a world of more temptations and risks than
the English boy. A great deal of disclosed
Russian genius must be poisoned between
the ages of twelve and twenty by certain social
conditions which no one in Russia seems
capable of making an effort to clear up.
The Russian town of to-day is no doubt none
too easy for the young woman, and it seems
a sort of hell for the young man, a long
burning and the worm which dieth not.
Health, health, how to obtain conditions of
health, that is the problem!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>I was speaking to a somewhat famous
Russian senator about the deportation of
superfluous population from Petrograd and
he said: “The decentralisation of our cities’
populations is one of the things which
are coming. Why should Moscow and
Petrograd increase in size? They only do
so at the expense of Russia as a whole. We
have plenty of room for all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I strayed into various cafés in strange
towns this summer and ordered my coffee
and settled down to write parts of a long
book on religion and life with which I was
preoccupied all these months in Russia. I
was generally intent to sit down and write
out some idea which had occurred to me
whilst I had been walking. One evening I
found myself in a typical den&mdash;the long alley
of a café with women on each side,
painted, powdered, striking, their legs
crossed or spread about the table legs, cigarettes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
in their hands, half-finished glasses of
coffee in front of them.</p>

<p>Down the alley came young men with
flickering eyes and lips, now and then a leer,
a sickly smile, a cynical or satirical grin.
“This is the world,” think the young men,
“this is the gay wicked world where what
should never be sold can be bought.”</p>

<p>But they are wrong&mdash;it is only a wee
wicked corner. The great wide world is
sweeter, healthier.</p>

<span class="small">OLD FRIENDS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I met</span> Alexander Alexandrovitch Beekof,
the hunter of Archangel at Moscow. He
had purchased three fine pictures by our
friend Pereplotchikof, and they stood in his
room in the Gostinny Dvor in wooden packing
cases. Alexander Alexandrovitch stood
me a lunch at Martianitch’s in the Red
Square on a meatless day&mdash;a merchant’s restaurant
where you may see many antique
Russian types of merchants wearing knee
boots and blouses and longish hair. We
had a nice dish of fish-pie (<i>rastegai</i>) with
our soup, and though no wine was available,
the bill, as I saw, for the two of us was
twenty roubles, and three roubles more went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>for the tip. In that way war prosperity expressed
itself. My friend had to spend
many days in Moscow collecting boots in
small parcels. As the Government allows
no packing-cases with goods to be taken by
train from Moscow to Archangel (I imagine
fine art is exempted from this regulation),
Alexander Alexandrovitch Beekof
had to buy some twenty portmanteaus to
take his purchases of boots back to his native
city.</p>

<p>Pereplotchikof the painter is not very
well. Heart weakness deprived him of the
use of his legs this summer. He was confined
to his bed and felt very wretched. I
spent many mornings and evenings sitting
and talking to him. The doctors say that
vegetarianism has been too much for his constitution.
One evening I brought him a
quantity of rich honey I had come across in
a little shop in Moscow. He was delighted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>as a child, and honey he said was ideal food
for him. In exchange for this gift he gave
me an old cross which he had once picked
up on a market stall.</p>

<p>Alexey Sergeitch came with me to visit
Pereplotchikof one evening and was much
touched to see the change in him. But we
had a very lively talk of old days on the
Dwina. Alexey Sergeitch is now a teacher
of history in several secondary schools in
Moscow. He has just published his first
book, the fruit of some historical research,
and he looks forward to writing other books
of like character, so making a career in history.
He has the directly opposite view to
mine regarding Russia and we had many
long and inconclusive debates on Church
and State. His sister, Varvara Sergevna, is
nurse in an immense military hospital on
the Volhonka. I spent an evening up till
midnight with her, helping to cut rolls of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>linen for bandages with atrociously blunt
scissors. Russia has few machines for this
work. Every night thousands of Russian
girls are arduously cutting linen as we did
with Varvara.</p>

<p>Nicholas, my first Russian friend, whom
I met in London ten years ago and tried to
learn Russian from, the boy who invited
me to spend my first Christmas in Russia at
his father the deacon’s in Lisitchansk, is
now settled down and married, and has a
family at Kishtim in the Urals, where his
knowledge of English has found him a place
in the office of an Anglo-Russian mining
company.</p>

<p>Nicholas and I lived with another poor
student, three in a room, in Moscow&mdash;that
was after the Christmas in the country.
Our most intimate friend was a certain
Sasha, a gaunt but happy student of philology.
He used to bring stories and read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>them aloud to our weekly student parties on
Saturday evening. From him I heard first
some of the stories of Kuprin and also Chekhof’s
Dushetchka or “Little Soul,” which
Mrs. Garnett has lately translated under the
title of “The Darling”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;a famous story.
Sasha has grown cold to Nicholas now, and
I had lost sight of him, but the many references
to my work in the Russian Press
brought to his mind the idea that the Englishman
he once knew was the same as the
one now so well known. So he wrote to
me, and I tried to see him this summer&mdash;married
now and in good circumstances,
working in the Russian Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Julia, of whom I wrote in “The Way of
Martha and the Way of Mary,” as a type
of a Martha, has had a year of pain, caught
erysipelas from a servant, and this developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
into a sort of blood-poisoning. Sores
appeared all over her body, and then one big
sore threatening her with death; she has
been, as it were, vivisected through the open
wound all the summer, and felt that she herself
must have cut up live animals for science’s
sake in some previous existence, and is
now living through the animals’ experience
that her soul may really know what it means.
She has been in terror lest her sisters should
be infected from her and she has been afraid
lest she should die and they be left without
her motherly protection. Poor Julia! But I
left her on a fair way to recovery. Little
Lena is very well. The old lady, the
Queen of Spades, is more frail and is suffering
from the effects of a bad fall.</p>

<p>Varvara Ilyinitchna is much older, has
lost a son, has had heart attacks, and is
bound to take things more easily. Alexander
Fedotch looks extremely well. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>daughter is matron of a small hospital, and
has a wonderful time with her men.</p>

<p>Amelia Vasschevina, the old grandmother,
has sold the white house, has paid
her debts and has a large margin over. I
fear, however, high prices will whittle her
little fortune of ready money away. Her
daughter Masha, the despair of all doctors,
suffering from an incurable internal complaint
which has been diagnosed as cancer,
appendicitis, neuritis, inflammation of the
solar plexus and what not, and for which
she has had all manner of treatment and
swallowed all sorts of medicine, has recommenced
her work as a dentist. And though
suffering agonies of pain she has the nerve
to doctor teeth and smile at the lugubrious
and fearful faces of her patients. Poor
Masha, she has been cut open and examined
and sewn up again, mesmerised, prayed into,
and this last spring a miracle worker was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>brought to consider her. He always carried
about with him an Indian sword.</p>

<p>He said: “Don’t tell me what you think
is the matter with her or what the symptoms
are. That would only make it more difficult
for me.” He came into her room
took out a bit of glass from a waistcoat
pocket, and looked at her face through it.</p>

<p>“You will live,” said he, and he dropped
his glass and went away. “But I charge you
nothing,” he added, and he brandished his
sword as he went out at the door.</p>

<p>Loosha, of whom I have sometimes written,
feels more happy than she has ever done
before. What the secret is I do not know.
But she has begun to write poetry.</p>

<p>Katia of Kief married the young lawyer.
He was taken for the war, but the family
used influence to bring him back to a safe job
in the rear. I do not know what happened
to discarded Boris.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>
<p>Mme. Odintsefa is still keen on her evangelicals,
and reads Spurgeon’s sermons with
the same enthusiasm as in old days she read
Mrs. Besant.</p>

<span class="small">RUSSIA’S NEW WAR PICTURE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Russia</span> has now a popular war-picture done
by one of the most famous of her artists,
Nesterof. It appeared during the past winter,
and prints of it are now exposed in every
city, postcard reproductions on every book-stall
in Russia. It shows a wounded Russian
officer standing beside a Russian sister
of mercy. He is in khaki, and is decorated
with the Order of St. George; she in white
hospital dress. Both faces are marvellously
expressive of suffering&mdash;the woman seems
drowned in past suffering, and yet aware of
the immensity of suffering that yet must
come. The man has the vision in his eyes
that makes it all worth while.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>
<p>Her face is one of faith, his of vision.
Together they express the ideal relationship
of a man and a woman, he fighting the
great fight, living life as it ought to be lived,
she supporting him with her faith and her
love.</p>

<p>Nesterof when he was yet a boy began to
paint frescoes in churches, and has painted
in his time many a wonderful Madonna and
Child. In this picture where he has descended
to paint just a woman and a man
in the midst of daily life you may see a sort
of suggestion of the Mother and Child, a reflection
of some other composition, of some
Russian Madonna and leaping Babe. Here
also the man is really a child, though his
eyes have the knowledge of the ideal and
the quest, and the woman’s face has purity
and love and foreknowledge of the suffering
that must come.</p>

<p>The background of the picture is Russia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>the green forest of pines and firs, the melancholy
placid lake, the wan white church
with its swelling coloured dome. Russia
is in the background. Russia bore them,
and their hearts yearn towards her.</p>

<p>So it can be a popular Russian war picture
and be hung on many walls and looked
into and loved in this strange year of grace
1916.</p>

<p>The words printed below are the famous
lines of the poet Khomiakoff:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>podvig</i> is in battle:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>podvig</i> is in struggle:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The highest <i>podvig</i> is in patience,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Love and prayer.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I leave the word <i>podvig</i> because, as I
wrote in my chapter explaining the word in
“Martha and Mary,” it is difficult to render
it by any one word in English. But it is
one of the most important words in the Russian
language. Here possibly the nearest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>word is “trial.” It means a noble deed, an
act of faith, a noble battle against fearful
odds, a great sacrifice or act of renunciation,
a shaming of the devil, a bold religious affirmation.
Volumes might be written on it.
The acts of the anchorites and hermits are
<i>podvigs</i>. St. George killing the dragon performed
a <i>podvig</i>. The seven champions of
Christendom would in Russia be the seven
<i>podvizhniks</i> and their heroic exploits <i>podvigs</i>,
but there we have not a word. For
performing <i>podvigs</i> Russian soldiers are
decorated. But, as Nesterof tells us in his
picture, there are the greatest for which
there is no decoration.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">The greatest <i>podvig</i> is in patience,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Love and prayer.</div></div></div></div>

<p>The sound of these Russian words is so beautiful
in the original tongue that inevitably
after you have read them you go on murmuring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
them till they are yours&mdash;a possession
of the heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Podvig yest ee f srazhenie:</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Podvig yest ee f borbay:</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Veeshy podvig f terpenie,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Liubvy i molbay.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not absolutely correct transliteration,
but I have written in the hope that it
maybe easier to say.</p>

<p>This picture is true for Russia and will be
valuable long after peace has come as a historical
witness of the spirit of the time. In
the war, despite all its ugliness and accidentoriness,
human nature is revealed as more
beautiful, more daring, also more tender.
The Russians have this picture, and we also
have the reality. There is a strong spiritual
life manifest among us. It is manifest in the
faces of the soldiers and in the life of their
anxious and loving women they leave behind.
Will not some one paint it for us?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV<br />
<span class="small">IN THE HOSPITAL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I visited</span> several hospitals in Moscow,
Rostov, and Petrograd. Those in the north
had not many wounded, those in the south
had the men who had been hurt in Brusilof’s
advance. Russia looks her best in hospital
where the men are suffering not only for
Russia but for us, where the appearance of
the men has the idealisation of hospital dress,
and the transfiguration of care. There is
no more sweet possession for a woman than
a hospital where tenderness and love may be
lavished and patience given without end.</p>

<p>Russia has had generally more wounded
than any other nation, and the arrangements
for the receipt of the wounded have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>wonderful all the time. Despite a national
incapacity for organisation, the wounded
have not died for want of care and forethought.
In that speaks the Russian compassion
and love for suffering humanity.
The nursing of the wounded is an endless
tale of personal devotion.</p>

<p>Several of my Russian women friends are
in hospitals, and I visited them and talked to
the soldiers, heard all the tales of their prowess.
Surprising what a number of boys
there are among the wounded, young fellows
of thirteen or fourteen who have managed
somehow to get into the Army. It was
difficult to know how to address them&mdash;as
boys or as men.</p>

<p>I visited the Anglo-Russian Hospital at
Petrograd one evening, and saw how our
English sisters have become friends with the
simple Russian lads, sit at their bedside with
dictionary and notebook, and carry on delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and pathetic conversations. The
Russian authorities will not allow a
wounded man to leave until he is well
enough to return to his unit. The consequence
is that the wounded man remains
longer in a hospital in Russia than he would
in a similar hospital in England. And the
longer they stay the better are they known
to those who tend them. The English in the
hospital on the Nevsky at Petrograd obtain
a fair notion of the character and temperament
of the Russian soldier. My impression
was that they admired and loved him
greatly. He was all that had been written
of him and said of him, and something
more&mdash;religious, simple, brave, patient,
cheerful, and sociable. Jolly boys these
Russian wounded, not dour like Cromwell’s
soldiers although they are as religious as
his, not Puritans, not intolerant. No one
asks suspiciously of the sister nursing him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>“Are you not perhaps a Protestant?” And
then feels suddenly, “I am saved and she is
damned,” but a general feeling that God’s
mercy is needed more for the poor suffering
soldier than for the bright angel who is
nursing him.</p>

<p>When our women were on the point of
going out to Russia to work in this Anglo-Russian
Hospital I confess I felt a doubt
as to whether they would not find fault when
they got to Russia and dislike the Russian
Tommy because he was unlike his British
brother. But I was wrong. The Russian
peasant is convincing when you see him day
after day, and it is your lot to tend him
whilst he is suffering. Singing their national
songs and their national Church
music in those good choruses which without
selection any hospital affords, you hear the
voice of Russia with your ears be they keen
or dull, and dressing wounds and watching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>you see character. Undoubtedly if the
same party of British nurses and doctors
were thrown simply into the midst of ordinary
educated men and women in Petrograd
or Moscow instead of being given to the
wounded they might easily come away with
a less true impression.</p>

<p>But here amongst the men suffering for
you and me and all of us is Holy Russia,
which was and which is.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of spiteful nonsense
is written against the notion of Russia
conveyed by the term Holy Russia, and I
among others am blamed for idealising Russia,
or as Mr. Zangwill puts it, of Ruskinising
her. And another Hebrew writing under
an assumed name finds fault with me
because I said at the National Liberal
Club, “Love Russia, and do not distrust her
as you have done in the past.” Another
Russian Jew, who has been embittered by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>political treatment writing also under a
pseudonym, pursues a violently misrepresentative
campaign in Russia against the conception
of Russia as a country that can be
spiritually helpful to us.</p>

<p>How bitter these other friends of Russia
are! They are those who have suffered
through political disabilities; they are those,
who not being Christian cannot be expected
to be touched as we are; they are those who
would prefer to see in Russia a free but non-Christian
democracy as in France; for that
end they are political revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Holy Russia is a living fact. And if it
had ceased to be, study of Russia would be
merely history and archæology. Nietszche
said to German women, “Hope that your
child may be the superman&mdash;the antichrist&mdash;hope
that he may be a Napoleon.” The
covenant to Russian women and to our
women is “Hope that your child may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>the Christ-child.” It is the Christian thing
which Russia has to give, and may God
help the Christian background of Russia to
shine clear to Europe. If Russia were
merely Sturmer, Protopopof, Gorky, Rubinstein
(the finance manipulator), Reinbot
(who organised the police graft of Moscow),
Rasputin (the debauched Siberian),
Sukhomlinof (who is at rest in the fortress
of Peter and Paul), Masoyedof (who was
hanged for betraying Russia), Azef, Milyukof,
Kerensky, Count Benckendorf, etc.,
etc., how little interest she would have for
us!</p>

<p>If the crassly selfish, materialistic, middle-class
of the Russian towns were Russia,
who would stir one little finger to be
friendly with her, except simply our commercial
people who see that money can be
made in Russia?</p>

<p>No one has shown more unsparingly the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>dark side of the Russian life than I have in
my books. In describing the pilgrimage
to Jerusalem I described the exploitation
that I saw. I have perhaps even gone too
far in describing the uglinesses of modern
Russia (in “Changing Russia”). But I do
believe in Holy Russia, and as far as Russia
is concerned do not care for anything else.
I hate to see her being commercialised and
exploited, and to see her vulgar rich increasing
at the expense of the life-blood of
the nation. Without any question the new
class of middle-rich coming into being
through Russia’s industrial prosperity is the
worst of its kind in Europe. They are
worse than anything in Germany, and it is
they who are beginning to have the power in
Russia. It is the green and inexperienced
who think that power wrested from the
Tsar and his Court is grasped by the idealists
of Russia. It is grasped by the capitalists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and often by the foreign capitalists.</p>

<p>Poor Russia, she has not many faults, she
has only many misfortunes. I am asked to
discount Holy Russia and set off various
things against it. The Russians steal&mdash;well,
they did not steal in the villages till the
railway came, bringing the thieves. And
where there are no railways now there are
no thieves. They lie&mdash;that is a matter for
psychological inquiry. They do not lie as
we lie. They are cruel. So are we all,
but the Russians are tender also. Tenderness
is their characteristic. What else is
there to say against the Russian peasant?
He does not work enough.</p>

<p>Well, grant everything, admit all that can
be said against him, and subtract all from
Holy Russia. I am not afraid to do it. I
have had to do it long ago for myself. And
there still remains Holy Russia, the beautiful,
spiritual individuality of the nation.</p>

<span class="small">THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1916 closes in peace discussion.
There has always seemed to me to be a likelihood
that the war, the khaki and the guns,
the gallant men and the sacred graves alike
would be snowed over with papers and
eventually almost lost sight of. Some eloquent
German pastor cried out in a war sermon&mdash;</p>

<p><i>“White snow, white snow, fall, fall for
seven weeks; all may’st thou cover, far and
wide, but never England’s shame; white
snow, white snow, never the sins of England.”</i></p>

<p>Our attitude would be rather: Never the
sins of Germany. But even they must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>covered at last. And the snow which the
pastor asked for has begun to fall, blown by
a somewhat gusty westerly wind.</p>

<p>It is America that is sending it across and
I imagine that Americans would be specially
interested what Russians think of the
prospects for peace.</p>

<p>The problem of peace as it affects Russia
differs somewhat from the problem as it
affects France and Britain. It is well to
keep in view the central facts.</p>

<p>Germany made war on Russia and showed
herself ready to sacrifice Russia on the altar
of her own greatness. The Kaiser so far
from being on friendly terms with the Tsar,
set out to despoil the Tsar of tracts of territory.
Russia being an autocracy much
more depended on the Tsar and his ministers
than on the Duma or the voice of the
people manifested in the press. He answered
War with War. As far as can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>ascertained no attempt was made by so-called
“Germans at court” to stave off war or
make a pact with Germany and sacrifice
France. Several large German landowners
sold their estates and returned to the
Fatherland before the war broke out, for
they knew the cash was coming. Germany
did not wish to come to an understanding
with Russia before July, 1914. Germany
thought it more profitable to sacrifice the
Russians than to share with them power in
Europe.</p>

<p>The German people confident in the possession
of an enormous armament and of a
genius for organisation which put them
first and the rest nowhere, despised Russia.
Russia’s friendship was not worth striving to
obtain. There were admirable foundations
for building a German-Russian friendship
of a most lucrative kind, deep German roots
in finance, commerce, government and administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
and blood ties and inter-marriages
amongst important German and Russian
families, but it was thought to be more
profitable to fight than to be friends.</p>

<p>Doubtless a German victory would have
increased the profits of many pseudo-Russian
merchant houses. But from the Imperial
point of view it should be borne in
mind that there is probably not the slightest
doubt or vagueness in the Tsar’s mind,
and there has not been since the outbreak of
war. The Kaiser has not only injured but
has insulted Russia. There is a quarrel
which can only be happily settled by the
Germans being beaten utterly in the field.</p>

<p>The Russian people ratified the decision
of the Tsar. There was a very great unanimity,
doubtless revolutionary Russia was
glad to be fighting for the same cause as
republican France and free England. The
war has been called all manner of things
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>pleasing from a liberal point of view, a war
to protect small nations, a war against militarism,
a war of progress against reaction.
But fundamentally it is a quarrel. The
press can say what it likes and theorists may
theorise in terms interesting or not interesting
to those at the head of affairs. But
they for their part know one thing clearly,
that it is a quarrel&mdash;it does not matter how
people justify it to their consciences as long
as they co-operate heartily in the great task
of defeating the enemy.</p>

<p>The war, however, goes on a long time
and there have been many blunders and
scandals. The political extremists care for
one thing more than for defeating Germany
and that is for their political game at home
whatever it may be. It has occurred to
them&mdash;cannot the war be made the means of
overthrowing the autocracy as such, by making
ministers responsible to the Duma instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
of to the Emperor as heretofore. And
since the Russian retreat of 1915 a large political
game with important possibilities has
developed. Political war of a kind has
raged unceasingly and rages now.</p>

<p>This has played a little into German
hands and had it not been for the complete,
steadfast and unwavering hostility of the
Tsar towards Germany, Russia would have
succumbed to the seductions of internal
strife. Germany as it is, hopes steadily for
revolution in Russia&mdash;for a nation divided
against itself cannot stand.</p>

<p>All through 1916 a rumour, however, has
been persistently spread by word of mouth
that the Tsar was likely to sign a separate
peace. Every scandal that could damage
the name of the Tsar has been repeated and
magnified&mdash;the object being to obtain a
transference of French and British sympathies
from the Tsar and his ministers to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>Duma and the progressive parties in the
nation. Such a transference of sympathy
would naturally endanger the stability of
Russia and play into the German hands&mdash;quite
apart from the question of the future of
Russian internal government and control.</p>

<p>I cannot record here the gossip about
Rasputin, Sturmer, the Empress, the falls of
ministers. An immense amount of random
rubbish is talked in Russia. Talking political
scandal is one way of passing the
time. The influence of Rasputin (a Siberian
peasant and not a monk, not a priest,
though he called himself Father and gave
blessings) was greatly exaggerated. Some
ladies took him up, as miracle-workers and
magicians are taken up when they can be
found. But he never had any influence with
the Tsar. He seems to have been a curious
character but he is now dead and the gossip
about him will cease. I do not believe he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>was working for Germany&mdash;as he had very
little notion of what Germany was and could
not even pronounce three consecutive words
of his own language correctly. He was an
obscure being and degraded even so. He
prophesied that the Tsarevitch would lose
his health if he, Rasputin, should cease to
support him. I should say the boy’s health
would improve, now that the black arts have
been removed.</p>

<p>Sturmer, the ex-Premier, was the most
unpopular prime-minister Russia has had.
He, happily, has gone. And in Russia they
never come back.</p>

<p>The fall of Sazonof was a shock. The
motive for his retirement is said to be the
Japanese agreement which he arranged. It
was also said to be due to disagreement over
Poland. The British diplomatic body has
undoubtedly leaned on Sazonof and would
like to bring him back. Our diplomacy in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>Russia during 1916 has, however, been in no
way inspired. Its object seems to have been
to play a political game, as at Salonika so
at Petrograd, and to back the Duma at any
cost. Buchanan has turned out to be an extraordinary
speech maker; a contrast to the
silent Russian Ambassador in London.</p>

<p>A cloud has been over the East obscuring
it from our eyes. Happily however at the
end of the year the cloud has lifted. Sturmer
has gone. Rasputin is dead and Russia
has announced clearly by the voice of
her new minister and emphatically through
the lips of the Tsar what she is fighting
for.</p>

<p>The Tsar’s message to his army before
Christmas has more significance in it than
many parliamentary debates, speeches of
ministers or theories of theorists, and I leave
it fittingly as the close of this attempt at a
political elucidation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is now more than two years since Germany
in the midst of peace and after secretly
preparing over a long period to enslave all
the nations of Europe, suddenly attacked
Russia and her faithful Ally France. This
attack compelled England to join us and
take part in our battle.</p>

<p>The complete disdain which Germany
showed for principles of international law as
demonstrated by the violation of the neutrality
of Belgium and her pitiless cruelty
towards the peaceful inhabitants in the occupied
provinces, little by little united the
Great Powers of Europe against Germany
and her ally Austria.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of the German troops,
which were well provided with the technical
aids to warfare, Russia and France
were compelled in the first year of the war to
give up a portion of their territory, but this
temporary reverse did not break the spirit of
our faithful Allies, nor of you my gallant
troops. In time, by the concentrated efforts
of the Government, the disparity of our own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>and the German technical resources was
gradually reduced. But long before this
time, even from the autumn of 1915, our
enemy was experiencing difficulty in retaining
the territory he had occupied, and in the
spring and summer of the current year suffered
a number of severe defeats and assumed
the defensive along the whole front.
His strength apparently is waning, but the
strength of Russia and her gallant Allies
continues to grow without failing.</p>

<p>Germany is feeling that the hour of her
complete defeat is near, and near also the
hour of retribution for all her wrong-doings
and for the violation of moral laws. Similarly,
as in the time when her war strength
was superior to the strength of her neighbours,
Germany suddenly declared war
upon them, so now, feeling her weakness, she
suddenly offers to enter into peace negotiations
and to complete them before her military
talent is exhausted. At the same time
she is creating a false impression about the
strength of her Army by making use of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>temporary success over the Rumanians, who
had not succeeded in gaining experience in
the conduct of modern warfare.</p>

<p>But if, originally, Germany was in the position
to declare war and fall upon Russia
and her Ally France, in her most favourable
time, having strengthened in wartime
the Alliance, among which is to be found all
powerful England and noble Italy, this
Alliance in its turn has also the possibility
of entering into peace negotiations at
such a time as it considers favourable for
itself.</p>

<p>The time has not yet arrived. The
enemy has not yet been driven out of the
provinces occupied by her. The attainment
by Russia of the tasks created by the
war&mdash;the regaining of Constantinople and
the Dardanelles, as well as the creation of a
free Poland from all three of her now incomplete
tribal districts&mdash;has not yet been
guaranteed.</p>

<p>To conclude peace at this moment would
mean the failure to utilise the fruits of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>untold trials of you, heroic Russian troops
and Fleet. These trials, and still more the
sacred memory of those noble sons of Russia
who have fallen on the field of battle, do not
permit the thought of peace until the final
victory over our enemies.</p>

<p>Who dares to think that he who brought
about the beginning of the war shall have it
in his power to conclude the war at any time
he likes?</p>

<p>I do not doubt that every faithful son of
Holy Russia under arms who entered into
the firing line, as well as those working in
the interior for the increase of her war
strength or the creation of her industry, will
be convinced that peace can only be given
to the enemy after he has been driven from
our borders; and then only when, finally
broken, he shall give to us and our faithful
Allies reliable proof of the impossibility of
a repetition of the treacherous attack and
a firm assurance that he will keep to these
promises. By the strength of these guarantees
he will be bound to the fulfilment in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>times of peace of those things which he undertakes.</p>

<p>Let us be firm in the certainty of our victory
and the Almighty will bless our standards
and will cover them afresh with glory,
and will give to us a peace worthy of your
heroic deeds, my glorious troops&mdash;a peace
for which future generations will bless your
memory.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nicholas.</span></p></div>

<p><i>Postscript</i>: 1915, 1916 and then <i>annus
mirabilis</i> we are told. Wonderful things
will happen in 1917. That means we hope
and expect peace in 1917. Germany does
also. The only peace possible, however,
seems to be that of complete victory over
the enemy. As a personal opinion I think
it unlikely that complete victory will be obtained
in 1917. It is also unlikely that a
compromise peace will be effected. The
bill against Germany is too heavy for the
German nation to accept.</p>

<p>If instead of making a vague general offer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>of peace in December, 1916, Germany had
offered the <i>status quo</i> we might possibly with
great humiliation and vexation have all accepted
the proposal. I think we should not,
but we conceivably might. But Germany
and her allies would have liked to keep some
of the fruits of their victories and they
could not then offer <i>status quo</i>. In all probability
they will offer it later but then it will
be too late as it is too late now in January,
1917. The bill against the Germans grows
more heavy every day and every week the
war is prolonged. Our chance of victory
over them at the same time seems to increase
as steadily. Next summer when the Germans
have been routed in France and Belgium
and Poland&mdash;shall we be more likely
to consider a peace that would be acceptable
to the Germans? I am sure not. Will
Russia be more ready? Certainly not.
Rather the demands on Germany will have
increased.</p>

<p>I do not write this urging more war or
craving for peace, but rather as a commentator.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
I am sorry for the Germans in a way.
But I realise that in July-August, 1914, they
chose a line of action from which followed a
certain set of consequences if they failed.</p>

<p>We on the Entente side have not improved
our cause. We have tried to fight the Germans
in their way. We have seemed to behave
abominably in Greece&mdash;have become
entangled in an irrelevant political quarrel
there. But then we have simply been doing
the best we can, according to our ability.
Not many idealists would rush to offer their
life for our cause now and great numbers
have lost interest in it. But the unsolvable
quarrel remains. How long the war will
last seems to depend chiefly on the length of
time the German armies can hold out against
the ever-increasing machinery of death and
destruction which faces them.</p>

<span class="small">HOME</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Because</span> of the regulations regarding taking
printed matter in one’s luggage I was
obliged to post to London some thirty packets
of books. Possibly by appealing to our
Embassy at Petrograd I might have obtained
what is called a Foreign Office bag and have
been immune from censor revision. A considerable
number of British subjects are accommodated
in this way. But it seems to
me to be an incorrect thing to do.</p>

<p>I had bought some dozens of pictures
and ikons. I had precious manuscript
which I should not dream of trusting to the
post, and if it had been proposed to confiscate
that manuscript at Archangel as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>stepped aboard I should have remained in
Russia to save it. But I got through without
trouble.</p>

<p>Our people at Archangel were extremely
kind to me, and put me on a returning ammunition
ship, and I went all the way to
Britain in comfort and without change.</p>

<p>The boat was a turret ship, one of those
with hollowed-in sides, constructed to evade
the true charges of the Suez Canal, where
the toll is according to the breadth of the
vessel. It had been ten times a year through
the Suez Canal for twenty years, and now
for the first time in its history was in northern
latitudes. The crew were shivering
Lascars, tripping about in one garment and
looking more like girls than men. Each
and every one had received from the Government
two warm suits of underclothing,
woolly trousers, coats, and wraps, but these
things were locked away in their boxes, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>you could not persuade them to wear one.
For the Lascar is a real Jew in temperment
and has a passion for selling clothes and
chaffering over them.</p>

<p>We steamed out gently through the traffic
and along the narrow channels of the
many-mouthed river, and after some hours
got clear into the White Sea.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>When we passed a buoy the captain, who
was rather a character, would retire to his
sitting-room, take up his concertina, and
play “Land of Hope and Glory,” the “Dead
March” in <i>Saul</i>, “Ip-I-addy,” and other
favourites.</p>

<p>We sailed under sealed orders and did not
sight another vessel except British war-ships
and patrol boats till we were nearing Lerwick.</p>

<p>In the Arctic there was calm, and we recaptured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the light which was fleeting with
the approach to the equinox. The evenings
grew appreciably longer. It was cold,
and the barometer was going down “for ice.”</p>

<p>The captain and officers felt the cold
badly, stamped to keep warm, and came in
to meals with red faces and bright eyes. “If
there is a Gulf Stream it ought to be warmer
than it is,” said the captain. “Do you believe
in its existence?”</p>

<p>I could not give an opinion.</p>

<p>“According to the hand-book, there is,”
said the skipper. “It flows north-east, but a
little note says ‘it has been known to flow
south-west.’ Two and two make four, but
they have been known to make five. All I
can say is that if there is a Gulf Stream we
are going against it at this moment and beating
our engines. Our maximum is 11-1/4
knots, and we are doing 12.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>
<p>It was touching to hear English coming
over the water when we were hailed by
British patrols.</p>

<p>“What is the name of the ship?”</p>

<p>“<i>Glamis.</i>”</p>

<p>“What is your cargo?”</p>

<p>“Wood&mdash;and&mdash;flax. Wood&mdash;and&mdash;flax.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, I can’t attend to you now, you’d
bettah drop your ankah.”</p>

<p>At one point, to the great disgust of the
skipper, we were stopped by a cruiser and
some twenty mail-bags were sent to us. And
we lost our steam. “They signalled us six
miles away. Why couldn’t they have said
they wanted us to slow up for mails, instead
of allowing us to come up at full speed,
and then giving us ‘Stop immediately’ and
making us reverse the engines and go full
astern.”</p>

<p>We were a lot of cheerful British grumblers.
I was the only passenger on board,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>and so got to know them all pretty well.
Every man was a character in his way, and
their remarks filled me constantly with
mirth.</p>

<p>Our last three days were stormy in the extreme&mdash;regular
equinoctial weather. The
captain did not sleep, for the waters were,
in his opinion, “too submariny.” I put out
my lifebelt and wrapped up my manuscripts
in a waterproof packet.</p>

<p>“What will happen should we strike a
mine or be torpedoed?” I asked of the captain.</p>

<p>“Unless the engines were blown up we
should proceed as best we could on the injured
ship,” said he. He showed me what
were the vital sections of the vessel.</p>

<p>“In any case we should not take to the
boats except in the worst extremity,” said
he. “For the Lascars have no will to live
and they would not row us far. We should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>throw three dead overboard every morning,
they so quickly lose hope.”</p>

<p>At Lerwick we learned the name of the
port for which we had to make. ’Twas
Aberdeen, and as the captain shouted this
to us from the boat in which he was returning
from the man-of-war, all the officers
rushed to look at their shipping almanacks
to see what the tides were. We made out
that we could just get in in time. And
the vessel that night did the best she ever
did.</p>

<p>Still we missed the tide and had to wait
all day outside Aberdeen, and that was very
tantalising. I had made up my mind to
stay the night at a hotel, and then suddenly
the Daylight Saving Bill made me an unlooked-for
present of an hour, and it was
possible to catch the 8.30 night train for
London.</p>

<p>An extremely cautious Customs Officer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>looked at my things, but said naught, and
he insisted on my unpacking the samovar
which I was bringing home. When he saw
it, he remarked:</p>

<p>“It’ll be something for taking pictures?”</p>

<p>He said this because I had put in the
chimney a number of pictures and maps to
keep them from crumpling.</p>

<p>The doctor when he came thought we
might be detained in quarantine for a week.
The captain had a sore throat. He must
go to a hospital and have a culture of it
taken.</p>

<p>“A lot of bally rot, I call it,” the captain
kept repeating, and tears were almost trickling
from his eyes.</p>

<p>The doctor, however, let me go, and I sent
a small boy to fetch a taxi. The taxi appeared
at about 8.25 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and I just got
to the station in time. There was half a
minute.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>
<p>“Take it easy, you’ve plenty of time,” said
a porter to me, characteristically.</p>

<p>All my possessions were labelled, and the
doors of the guard’s pan opened in the moving
train and accepted the extra bags. I
sped along through a throng of women waving
good-bye to soldiers, and got into a carriage
as by miracle.</p>

<p>There for a moment I paused and considered.</p>

<p>What a contrast to Russian ways, the possibility
of getting off by a train with such a
hairbreadth of margin.</p>

<p>The contrast was flattering to ourselves.</p>

<p>Soon, however, came another contrast, less
flattering. Two drunken men got in. I
was feeling particularly tender to everything
English, and could not possibly have felt
critical or wished to grumble.</p>

<p>But one of the drunken men wanted to
fight. He stood up and held on a minute to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>the window-strap, looked at me vaguely, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I pronounce my ultimatio.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Self-defence,” he replied, and then relapsed
into his seat with a bump.</p>

<p>So I was home. And all night long the
train rushed on to London.</p>

<p>This book describes a journey by the author through
Russian Central Asia. Among the topics which the author
touches upon are the Russian pioneers, Mohammedanism
and its characteristic expression, the colored tribes,
Russian rule, the expansion of the Russian empire and
the question of danger to India. The volume tells of
much tramping, of wayside experiences, of sights in the
desert and nights under the Asian stars or in the tents of
the nomads.</p>

<p>“A delightful book.... Always and everywhere
Stephen Graham has the gift of transferring his knowledge
of Russia to the reader’s heart and brain.”&mdash;<i>Chicago
Herald.</i></p>

<p>“Full of information and as charming as it is informing.
It is rich in the lure of the open road ... in the romance
of old cities, in the wildness of the vast waste spaces....
In the view it gives of a phase of Russian life entirely new
to American readers.”&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>Stephen Graham is a close student of Russia; he has a consuming
interest in the Russian nature and deep sympathy with Russian character.
For many years he has lived among the people of whom he
writes. “The Way of Martha and the Way of Mary” is a study of
Russian national characteristics, particularly as typified by her religious
spirit, which is contrasted with the spirit of Western Christianity.
A national idea, national unity, has its origin in the national religion,
and this is especially true of Russia, because the intensity of Russian
character demands some absorbing ideal to which it may turn.</p>

<p>“All that is beautiful in Russia’s life, art and culture,” writes Mr.
Graham, “springs from the particular and characteristic Christian ideas
in the depths of her. She is essentially a great and wonderful unity.
It is of that essential unity that I write.”</p>

<p>“The Way of Martha and the Way of Mary” is a valuable addition
to the list of important books Mr. Graham has written on Russia,
books that are treasuries of information and a source of inspiration to
those who love mankind.</p>

<p class="ph2 no-indent">Russia and the World</p>

<p class="right3"><i>Illustrated, cloth, 8vo, $2.00</i></p>

<p>For more than seven years Stephen Graham has been a close student
of things Russian. Compelled by an intense sympathy with the
country and its people, he forsook his native England and went to
Russia when he was twenty-three to study at first hand the life and
customs of that country. This was the beginning of an attachment
which grew stronger with the years and out of which have come several
of the most important contributions made to English literature bearing
on the Russia of modern times.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the present European war Mr. Graham was in
Russia, and his book opens, therefore, with a description of the way the
news of war was received on the Chinese frontier, one thousand miles
from a railway station, where he happened to be when the Tsar’s summons
came. Following this come other chapters on Russia and the
War, considering such subjects as, Is It a Last War?, Why Russia Is
Fighting, The Economic Isolation of Russia, An Aeroplane Hunt at
Warsaw, Suffering Poland: A Belgium of the East and The Soldier and
the Cross.</p>

<p>But “Russia and the World” is not by any means wholly a war
book. It is a comprehensive survey of Russian problems. Inasmuch
as the War is at present one of her problems it receives its due consideration.
It has been, however, Mr. Graham’s intention to supply the
very definite need that there is for enlightenment in English and
American circles as to the Russian nation, what its people think and
feel on great world matters. On almost every country there are more
books and more concrete information than on his chosen land. In fact,
“Russia and the World” may be regarded as one of the very first to
deal with it in any adequate fashion.</p>

<p class="right3"><i>Cloth, illustrated, 8vo, $1.75</i></p>

<p>“The author’s notes on people and places, jotted down in the open
air, while sitting on logs in the forests or on bridges over mountain
streams, form a simple narrative of a walking trip through Russia.
The sketches read like those of a rebel against modern conditions and
commercialism, who prefers to these the life of a wanderer in the wilderness.”&mdash;<i>Outdoor
World.</i></p>

<p>“A book throbbing with life which cannot help but prove of interest
to many readers. The book is a treasury of information, and will be a
source of great inspiration to those who love mankind; while the
author tells us much of the sorrow and degradation of the world he
also tells as much of his own high and noble thinking.”&mdash;<i>The Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“It is with life itself rather than the countries visited that this collection
of sketches is concerned. It is personal and friendly in tone,
and was written mostly in the open air while the author was tramping
along the Caucasian and Crimean shores of the Black Sea, and on a
pilgrimage with Russian peasants to Jerusalem.”&mdash;<i>Country Life in
America.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Graham has seen many interesting parts of the world, and he
tells of his travels in a pleasing way.”&mdash;<i>Suburban Life.</i></p>

<p class="ph2 no-indent">With Poor Immigrants to America</p>

<p class="right3"><i>Decorated cloth, 8vo, illustrated, $2.00</i></p>

<p>“We collected on the quay at Liverpool&mdash;English, Russians, Jews,
Germans, Swedes, Finns.... Three hundred yards out in the harbor
stood the red funneled Cunarder which was to bear us to America....”
The beginning of the voyage is thus described, a voyage during which
the reader sees life from a new angle. The trip across is, however, but
the forerunner of even more interesting days. Stephen Graham has
the spirit of the real adventurer and the story of his intimate association
with the immigrants is an intensely human and dramatic narrative, valuable
both as literature and as a sympathetic interpretation of a movement
which too frequently is viewed only with unfriendly eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Graham has the spirit of the real adventurer. He prefers
people to the Pullmans, steerage passage to first cabin. In his mingling
with the poorer classes he comes in contact intimately with a life
which most writers know only by hearsay, and interesting bits of this
life and that which is picturesque and romantic and unlooked for he
transcribes to paper with a freshness and vividness that mark him a
good mixer with men, a keen observer and a skillful adept with the
pen.”&mdash;<i>North American.</i></p></div>

<p><b>The journey of the Russian peasants to Jerusalem has never been
described before in any language, not even in Russian. Yet it is the
most significant thing in the Russian life of to-day. In the story lies a
great national epic.</b></p>

<p>“Mr. Stephen Graham writes with full sympathy for the point of
view of the devout, simple-minded, credulous peasants whose companion
he became in the trip by boat from Constantinople to Jaffa and
thence on foot to the holy places.”&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>“Apart from the value which must be attached to the authenticity of
the glimpses of Russian life that Mr. Graham gives in his latest book,
it also clearly ranks him as the best modern writer of the saga of vagabondage.”&mdash;<i>N.

a delightful mixture of description, impression, and delineation of a
peculiar but colorful character.”&mdash;<i>Book News Monthly.</i></p>

<p>“A book of intensely human interest.”&mdash;<i>The Continent.</i></p>

<p>“The book is beautifully produced, illustrated with thirty-eight exceptionally
fine snapshots, and is of commanding interest, whether read

tract of religious belief.”&mdash;<i>Christian Advocate.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
